90,683_6, Although it is possible to define custom ETW events and to generate those events the publicly available tooling does not currently provide a way to get access to these events ,0
91,683_7, The Windows Phone Developer Power Tools only enable collection of predefined profiles that use certain system events ,0
92,683_8, There appears to be no way to tell it to collect data from your own custom event sources ,0
93,683_9, So although in example NET based store apps the System Diagnostics Tracing EventSource class is available and can be used to generate custom ETW events there does not appear to be any point to this at the moment because you can not actually record those events in a trace ,0
94,683_10, Just to be clear this is not a duplicate of url as a reply in that thread points out you can already log ETW events from a WP app ,0

127,690_2, Fast resume has pretty much killed my app and I can not delete the WP XAP from the store and as such it looks like my app will not be able to go back on the WP Store or if it does it will have to be under a new name and abandon previous customers ,0

147,693_5, I do not know why there is no support for current devices to read NFC cards tags in full at a low level ,0
148,693_6, Seems deceptive to say that the device has NFC capabilities if in reality it can only read a very specific type of tag ,0
149,693_7, For one of our products we need to support NFC card reading writing with existing devices and several types of cards Mifare UL ULC Calypso Desfire maybe even more I have read that for WP the functionality will be added but only for devices with a specific NFC chipset which is currently not present in any of the devices ,0

155,694_3, When porting my Windows app to Windows Phone I feel that the Universal App template which is already awesome could do some other things to increase even more productivity Create Pages and UserControl folders Let us face it unless we want to create sh apps we will not have the same UI for all platforms so we will end up creating the same pages and controls in BOTH versions ,0
156,694_4, VS could create those folders in each project and bring in the classes pages and user controls from the original project ,0
157,695_1, I have stated the folder names I use Pages and UserControls but the rule could deal with other names as well ,0
158,696_1, I use SettingsFlyouts and I took some time to replicate them as pages in the Windows Phone project ,0
159,697_1, That could be automatic too ,1

161,698_1, Do the same for Styles xaml or whatever file contains Templates and Styles as done in ,0
162,698_2, I believe that other kinds of automatic measures could be taken but I only remember these because I ported a very simple app ,0
163,700_1, I recognize that when Threshold arrives code matching between Windows and Windows Phone achieves percent much of these may not matter anymore but for the time being these would be nice additions ,1
164,700_2, I have stated the folder names I use Pages more ,0

171,703_3, In the Windows store I can choose trial mode for my app and then pick the number of days I want the trial to last ,0
172,703_4, From there everything is taken care of for me ,0
173,703_5, If the user uninstalls during a trial it tracks this fact and prevents them from starting a new trial later ,0
174,703_6, Contrast this with the Windows Phone world where the developer indicates trial mode in the store but has to manually track the number of days since install whether the user has purchased etc ,0
175,703_7, If the user uninstalls and installs again later the developer has no idea ,0
176,703_8, Adding trial mode in Windows Phone feels like implement and pray ,0

187,712_1, I set the background to a fixed color black in the code and in the light theme the font color is set from white to black by Windows Phone automatically hence no text is readable ,0
188,713_1, This problem occured at multiple tens of code places in my case ,0
189,714_1, Adding the following four lines to a report that probably has been sent out thousands of times would have saved myself more than an hour of searching for an efficient solution and reading This might help with Dark Light theme problems Visibility Application Current Resources PhoneDarkThemeVisibility or similar Brush Application Current Resources PhoneBackgroundBrush and maybe additional links to documentation It would be much less frustrating for Windows Windows Phone developers to have hints sent with the certification failed reports which make it easier to tackle obvious issues that arise because of the restrictions of Windows Windows Phone ,0

348,767_2, However since phones are becoming more and more like computers used to be and hardware extensions are starting to appear like the Structure Sensor which is designed to work with IPhone and Android ,0
349,767_3, Since UMDF USB drivers are absolutely safe from harming the system thus guarding from penetrating the SP networks it would be a good idea to allow rd party registered device driver developers to be able to develop UMDF signed drivers submitted for testing and approval for such devices as I mentioned before ,1

464,796_7, I have apps I would like to transfer which had IAPs but I cannot do so ,0
465,796_8, The reason I removed the IAPs was to make the apps eligible for transfer ,0
466,796_9, Quite unfortunate ,0
467,796_10, Reasons to transfer an app Transfer ownership to a different person or group Ex An app is purchased by a different company ,0
468,796_11, Ideally it would be great to transfer an app including it is IAPs all intact ,1
469,796_12, Logistically I can imagine the nightmare that might be ,0
470,797_1, At the very least if IAPs are removed from the app and deleted from the dev account the app should become transferable ,0
471,797_2, I have apps I would like to transfer which had IAPs but I cannot do more ,0
472,797_3, The copyFolderAsync method is missing in WinRT for some non obvious reason ,0

481,799_4, When you apply new policies on already existing especially if it is related to name all the existing credibility and market is lost ,0
482,799_5, App is in store with current policies at that time there is no point applying new policies and make developer to work on old stuff ,0
483,799_6, When you are developing an app the generic policies will make sense ,0
484,799_7, But when a developer submitted an app and it is failing for a reason policies it is worth sending a developer exactly what happened with his her app ,0
485,800_1, What are the things went wrong rather than saying your app failing on it is generic message will be no use as the app is already developed reading these policies and with the understanding of these policies ,0
486,800_2, If you simply say an app failed with the policy number or so what can a developer benefit out of it rather he will be more confused and after a couple of times it will be frustrating ,0
487,800_3, After a little while developer may think that anyway they are not going thru what is the point in spending time here ,0
488,801_1, Be responsible and give more specific details why an app failed rather than pointing a policies which talks about several things ,1
489,801_2, May be this works with a firm company but for independent developers you are the source you are the helper ,0
490,801_3, If you simply say an app failed with the policy number or so what can a developer benefit out of it rather he will be more more ,0
491,802_1, Windows phone default calculator is annoying without being able to copy and paste numbers into the calculator app ,0
492,803_1, I find myself having to manually tab out get figures enter them in ,0
493,803_2, Easy fix add copy and paste function for adding figures and copying out figures ,1
494,803_3, Windows phone ,0
495,803_4, Needs copy paste functions to import export figures in and out of the calculator ,1
496,803_5, Copy any number of the internet documents and try and put it into calculator app ,0
497,804_1, You will find you have to do it manually ,0
498,805_1, I would be convinient if the copyAndReplaceAsync method would return something similar to the copyAsync method ,1
499,805_2, Namely the file that was replaced ,0
500,805_3, It would make chaining additional operations much more easier ,0
501,805_4, Having to RE enter things like version number application name etc when submitting a new app is just grounds for making mistakes ,0
502,806_1, In the App manifest I have already put the version number and I have already put the application name ,0
503,806_2, When I upload this XAP to the store look at the manifest and pre populate the corresponding fields in my submission instead of giving me a chance to mismatch them ,0

511,811_1, It is some more ,0
512,811_2, With windows phone I have a Nokia Lumia if I send an email with attached a small picture in the email that I receive the size of the attachment change depending on the body of the email ,0
513,812_1, Seems that the body is included in the image attached ,0
514,812_2, Try to send the same attachement with different email one with a line in the body and another with a lot of lines and see the difference in the attachement size ,0
515,812_3, Currently when the dialogue with first level of Windows Phone Store support is broken there is not any option to reach higher level and talk with someone who could resolve any kind of misunderstanding ,0
516,812_4, Windows Phone Support team can simply refuse further communication and everything stops there ,0
517,812_5, And unbelievably they are doing exactly that ,0
518,812_6, Azure support system is a very good example how this should work ,0
519,812_7, In every communication emails the support officer is manager and generic escalation emails are included ,0
520,812_8, Please do the same for Windows Phone Store unless you want to leave the developers and therefore the end users let down because of sub pair support quality ,1
521,812_9, Microsoft has to understand that refusing adequate support to developers will strike back as thousands of customers who are using that same publisher is applications will be left without further updates and improvements ,0
522,812_10, Please do the same for Windows Phone Store unless you want to leave the developers and therefore the end users more ,1

531,814_5, On my lumia with wp ,0
532,814_6, Please develop a new type based on string ie ,1
533,814_7, LocalizationString that will harness the Bing Translator API at the time of download by lazy translating the text into the device is local language and saving the translation dictionary of that app for future downloads of that locality or retrieve the existing copy of the app in that locality ,0
534,814_8, There are some bugs in notification center If there are so many notifications in notification center then it lags when i scroll it down i do not know that others are facing this problem or not but i think it is a major issue ,0
535,814_9, I found something which I think of as serious security bug ,0
536,814_10, I will start with the fact that I have got NOKIA L ith WP preview for developers ,0
537,814_11, What else could be important is that I have set additional security code so I have got two codes first for SIM card and second my own internal code which should be typed after a long time of phone inactivity ,0
538,814_12, I noticed that after the reboot of my mobile phone I can skip SIM code simply by pulling the screen down like clsing an app and then i only need to type my internal code in about cases SIM code panel will pop up but in the other no ,0
539,814_13, I can use all phone features except calling but getting access to other data is terrifying too ,0
540,814_14, I checked it a few times ,0
541,815_1, So my concern is that what will happen when someone uses only SIM code ,0
542,815_2, And what may cause that phenomenon ,0
543,816_1, I noticed that after the reboot of my mobile phone I can skip SIM code simply by pulling the screen down like clsing an app and then i only need to type my internal code more ,0
544,817_1, Currently windows phone is very restricted for developers ,0
545,817_2, It is not at all flexible ,0
546,817_3, Whatsapp cant send audios truecaller cant interpret incoming calls we cant access the list of apps installed and numerous others too ,0
547,817_4, all this is because of a simple reason ' Security ' which is important in corporate companies but casual users are more out there ,0
548,817_5, they should not be restricted like this ,1
549,817_6, so please develop two variants of windows phone OS ,1
550,818_1, Enterprise which will be the one that we have today and a basic version will be more flexible more open for users and developers ,0
551,818_2, Make SD boot fresh each time phone is restarted or double files with nothing in them to play then error ,1
552,819_1, Start button for notification light Calls msg all notification ,0
553,819_2, When using MapElement derived controls such as MapPolygon expose a Tap event ,0
554,820_1, In the event arguments allow some type of identification of the backing object such as the Tag property ,0
555,820_2, Or do not make these objects sealed so that we can add the needed functionality ourselves ,0
556,821_1, WP need to provide API ' S that allow developers to develop apps like APP locker That locks specific apps Using phone with lock not enough ,1
557,821_2, Hi Please add the From To options right after Download new email under each email account to specify when the phone is allowed to check emails ,1
558,821_3, Due to some spam emails the phone alerts me about new emails in the middle of the night ,0
559,821_4, It is extremely annoying ,0
560,821_5, Even my old phone Nokia E running on Symbian had an opportunity to specify the time period during which new emails will be checked ,0
561,822_1, The new Geolocator API and implementation is so unreliable that it can not be used with any confidence in a product ,0
562,822_2, Problems I have encountered While using PositionChanged event Geolocator ReportInterval seems to be ignored ,0
563,823_1, The simulator does a reasonable job of honouring the reporting interval phones seem to ignore it completely example ,0
564,825_1, ReportInterval set to second the phone would regularly take seconds and sometimes minutes to report ,0
565,826_1, As a developer I expect the ReportInterval to be honoured with a high degree of accuracy ,0
566,826_2, If the Phone does not have an accurate location simply return what it does have ,0
567,827_1, GetPositionAsync and GetGeopositionAsync TimeSpan TimeSpan regularly never return ,0
568,827_2, Because the event based location reporting is unreliable I have tried to use these APIs instead unfortunately they are also unreliable ,0
569,827_3, The GetGeopositionAsync method will work maybe times in a row and then simply stop working and never return despite having a timeout parameter ,0
570,828_1, In general the API is poorly designed ,0
571,828_2, Changing properties on an active Gelocator causes exceptions ,0
572,829_1, Getting the Geolocator to actually do something requires getting the magical and undocumented setting of properties correct and then attaching event handlers ie ,0
573,829_2, the API is too implicit it works on side effect rather than deliberate commands ,0
574,829_3, If the Phone does not have an accurate location simply return what it does more ,0
575,830_1, While i was trying to generate the project from the App studio it just hung ,0
576,831_1, It is showing the status ' generating ' for the past hour ,0
577,831_2, The Online Media extensibility is fantastic however it would be better if you allowed more sorting abilities for albums pictures and videos ,0
578,831_3, Currently the sorting is Albums Title Acsending Pictures Albums CreationTimestamp Acesending It would be good if there was more sorting either via the photo hub or via code which allows all items to be sorted title creation timestamp last updated timestamp ascending descending ,0
579,834_1, Hi forcing all WP apps upgraded to WP to behave differently on resume is causing me massive headaches ,0

583,834_5, Selecting Apps updated message in Windows Phone notification center should jump directly to app download history instead of jumping to the Store app but not showing the history ,1

585,834_7, Please provide a Quick Menu for Windows Phone something comparable to Win x menu in Windows but with possibility to edit and add menu items by the user ,1
586,834_8, The menu should be triggered by press and holding the standard Windows key ,1
587,834_9, That key combination is still free and the most logical place for a quick menu ,0
588,834_10, Make It possible to choose different sounds for different apps ,1
589,834_11, example ,0
590,834_12, Whatsapp and other apps use the default sound ,0

592,834_14, For example app submission certification gives you There was a problem processing this request ,0
593,834_15, Please try again after a few minutes in Firefox ,0
594,834_16, It worked in IE then ,0
595,834_17, It either does not play the short sound effect or plays it seconds too late ,0
596,834_18, I then used SharpDx for my app ,0
597,834_19, I also could not create a Mediaelement in Codebehind because it needs a strange path for phones and throws an exception ,0

600,834_22, This makes me incredibly unpopular with my accountant ,0
601,835_1, Would it not be possible to generate a simple invoice and email it to me ,0
602,835_2, Currently MS only seems to send snail mail invoices and only to certain countries way to go in leading the way with technology in business ,0

604,835_4, Because I receive a lot of spam flashSMS which I delete immediately I need a possibility to add phone numbers to blocked list manually ,1
605,835_5, I cannot pick the number from unanswered calls or somewhere else because those numbers are not stored in my phone ,0
606,835_6, Hi Currently WP allows to backup images so that low quality via data or high quality via wifi ,0
607,835_7, For security reasons I would really like to see an option that if the high quality backup via wifi is enabled and if the phone is not currently connected to wifi then the phone automatically creates resized smaller photo and uploads it via data to the cloud and then delete is the resized photo from the phone ,1
608,835_8, Then when the phone finds wifi and is able to connect it back up the original high quality picture and deletes the resized photo from the cloud too ,0
609,835_9, How is that for security ,0
610,835_10, Lets assume the phone is set not to automatically connect every available wifi network or there is no free wifi available ,0
611,835_11, If the phone is stolen and it is password locked it is still possible to take photos if enabled ,0
612,835_12, The thief may take a photo but if only the wifi backup option is enabled but there is no wifi available for the phone then the picture stays in the phone ,0
613,835_13, But if it were possible to automatically resize the image in the phone and upload it via data then it would be available for the phone is real owner ,0
614,835_14, The thief could take a picture of him herself then it can be given to police and or give idea of his her location ,0

705,853_1, It would be cool to allow the ApplicationBar to have more icons available ,1
706,853_2, So it could stick with the same row limit but could allow for wrapping so if there were items the applicationbar would expand to allow for the nd row of icons ,0
707,853_3, It would be also cool to allow for more than one application bar per page so you could specify one at the top left bottom or right ,1
708,855_1, The bottom could be quick links while the top or left side could be used for navigational purposes ,1
709,855_2, Please Combine All Windows Phone SKDs into one installation File so people download only one file and then check each version of WP SDKs that they want to install ,1
710,855_3, It will help to reduce misunderstandings ,0
711,855_4, Like Android and iOS Right now most of the people confused and built app compatible with WP instead of WP ,0
712,856_1, Hi I think it is useful if both windows phone x and windows x will have a similar way to access filesystem content and implement ALL the APIs here url url url url In particular having only the possibility of accessing media files through the XNA API does not deliver a UX on par with other platforms ,0
713,856_2, As an example we have a media player app for iOS Android Windows that does some sound processing and mixing between mp files available in the library and the recording of the mic ,0
714,856_3, Currently it is not possible for us to release this feature for windows phone too and this makes our loyal WP fans frustrated Hi I think it is useful if both windows phone x and windows x will have a similar way to access filesystem content and implement ALL the APIs here url url url url In particular having only the possibility of accessing media files through the XNA API does not deliver a UX on par with other platforms ,0
715,857_1, Currently it is not possible for us to release this feature more ,0
716,857_2, A translate this website button like is has on desktop and chrome also would be much helpful on a mobile device ,0
717,857_3, Hi Please extend Song Class with more useful properties such as LastPlayedDate AddedDate ,1
718,857_4, And optimize SongCollection to support similar filters ,1
719,857_5, These properties will allow developers to introduce many useful features such as Auto playlists and it ' ll also help xbox team to bring back Recently Added feature ,0
720,857_6, Full unsafe code support would Allow more code to be shared across platforms and Increase the performance of applications that needed it ,0
721,857_7, Here is a use case example I am the author of BEPUphysics a real time simulation library ,0
722,857_8, I wish to support many platforms as best I can with as much common code as possible ,0
723,857_9, Unfortunately in the current situation I can not have the best of both worlds ,0
724,857_10, If my goal is optimal performance I must maintain separate codebases for a bunch of low level queries and data structures ,0
725,857_11, On the other hand if my goal is as much common code as possible I am forced to use the suboptimal lowest common denominator crippling all of the other platforms ,0
726,857_12, Over time these competing motivations have resulted in a codebase that is harder to maintain yet still is not as fast as it could be ,0
727,858_1, While using C could provide the necessary access and performance many of the potential uses in simulation are sufficiently fine grained that dropping to C from C # repeatedly is at best horribly messy and at worst actually slower ,0
728,858_2, A full native implementation would address the performance side of things but I can not justify the massive expense of porting for just one platform ,0
729,858_3, It would also destroy a lot of value for the C # based users of the library ,0
730,858_4, Even if fallbacks had to be kept around to support other platforms that did not allow unsafe code enabling unsafe code on the phone would allow it to use the same efficient implementations as the computer ,0
731,858_5, This would be very useful in the resource constrained environment of a phone ,0
732,858_6, On the other hand if my goal is as much common code more ,0
733,858_7, When in a busy place Cortano does not understand anything ,0
734,858_8, Please improve that ,1
735,858_9, I often fiddle with the price of the In App Purchase IAP in my WP app to try and find the most profitable compromise between price and hashtag of purchases ,0
736,858_10, At present I have to manually record when I change the price as there appears to be no way to track this in the dev portal which seems strange given all the other info that is provided in the exported Excel file ,0
737,859_1, Ideally I would like to see a graph with both hashtag of purchases and purchase price plotted against time this would allow me to quickly see a change in rate of purchase vs price ,1
738,859_2, Ideally I would like to see a graph with both hashtag of purchases and purchase price plotted against time this would allow me to quickly see a change in rate of purchase more ,1
739,859_3, I think there should be a casual genre section as a lot of apps do not fall into any specific section already listed ,1
740,859_4, I installed the Chinese quick keyboard ,0
741,859_5, When I tried to use it to text someone the OS keeps on crashing and restarting ,0
742,859_6, Nokia Lumia windows ,0
743,859_7, A lot of different apps are needed to wake up in exact time and do something ,0
744,860_1, For example timer and alarm apps ,0
745,860_2, So we need improvement TimeTrigger class with AlarmApplicationManager accuracy ,1
746,861_1, And it should be possible to wait these triggers for many apps in the same time ,0
747,862_1, For RSS allow us to set custom settings for notifications and also allow us to enable the settings for users so they choose if they want notification or not ,1
748,863_1, Or allow infinite scrolling instead of default of items when a user scrolls down the list ,1
749,863_2, You have forgotten to change that icon ,0
750,863_3, At the moment anyone breaking through quiet hours does so at full volume ,0
751,864_1, That could be disruptive in a meeting ,0
752,864_2, Why not add a setting to the inner circle that allows me to turn off the ringtone and let it vibrate only ,1
753,865_1, Just a simple switch that says to the OS during quiet hours only use vibrate mode to alert me of a call or SMS breaking through ,0
754,865_2, the podcast app in windows phone if I stop a podcast and start another the bookmark for the previous podcast goes away and I have to search to find where I left off on the first podcast ,0
755,866_1, please make bookmarks for podcasts persistent after moving to another podcast and coming back ,1
756,866_2, It will be very useful if user can scan custom QR code from other screen or poster from phone Search Vision function and launch app via associated URI saved in QR code ,1
757,866_3, According to documentation it is only possible using NFC url ,0
758,867_1, Microsoft does not have it is own direction navigation app ,0
759,867_2, Third party apps does not provide accurate direction ,0
760,868_1, If they want to compete with Android and iPhone a good direction navigation system app is must on windows phone ,1
761,868_2, I am liking windows phone that I bought a couple of days ago but if I can not use the phone as my GPS navigation while driving it is not good for me ,0
762,868_3, It is best if photos can be processed on OneDrive ,0
763,868_4, The Photo app on Windows is not nearly good enough ,0
764,868_5, I have an image x with file size KB and it does not load ,0
765,868_6, Load error ,0
766,868_7, In the App Dev archive the photos are x ,0
767,869_1, Hence some reasonable feature should be implemented on App Studio OneDrive to make this possible ,1
768,870_1, I cannot get directions for Transit and Walk but for drive in the Maps for WP ,0
769,870_2, Also it is pretty slow ,0
770,870_3, Currently the Windows Phone SDK installs all the components within the SDK including the emulator ,0
771,870_4, However not all devices are compatible and the emulator images take up a large amounts of space and take lengthy times to download ,0
772,870_5, Users without compatible hardware are forced to download an unnecessary portion of the SDK without the ability to skip this feature ,0
773,870_6, As such please make the installation of the SDK optional during the SDK installation ,1
774,870_7, Tile can show is video ,0
775,870_8, Manage my total apps purchase by deleting the unwanted apps from the total list similar like google store And also give the ability to filter my payment purchased apps ,0
776,871_1, It would be helpful to be able to launch the calendar for a specific day i e I tell the user you have x appointments today Would you like to review them ,1
777,872_1, and then launch the calendar ,0
778,872_2, I would like to be able to enable WP alerts be forwarded to XBox One when I am near it or manually configured for it ,1
779,872_3, So if I get a Cortana alert or new email and I am playing CoD I can see it ,0
780,872_4, nofificaiones center had to be moved from the left meego guy already looks better and cleaner and so would not be copied anyone since nokia who introduced this feature as bought a nokia also all in the family ,0
781,873_1, If you shot a photo on native camera Microsoft Camera and see the photo on the app it do not delete a photo when you pick delete ,0
782,873_2, On Windows Phone the store bug when we open the store applications list coudn ' t load ,0
783,873_3, The store is unusable ,0
784,874_1, windowsphone ,0
785,874_2, Allow apps to download data like pocket for offline viewing ,1
786,874_3, In some places it is a problem that children are playing with their phones while in a class ,0
787,874_4, There must be a way to handle this kind of problem like statistics on how many times an app was started or not being able to start applications other than some basic apps ,0
788,874_5, The SD Card support in WP is practically useless because built in apps are the only ones allowed to access what are known as ' reserved file and URI associations ' ,0
789,874_6, url This means it is impossible to create an app that plays video or audio files stored on the SD card ,0
790,874_7, Many WP devices ship with only GB which makes the use of the SD card essential especially to store large files such as video ,0
791,875_1, We are presently working on a WP version of an app to play sign language videos but are stymied by this restriction ,0
792,878_1, We cannot read or even see any mp files on the SD card ,0
793,878_2, This limitation basically stops our project for WP ,0
794,879_1, Of course we have iOS and Android versions that work on phones ,0
795,879_2, Our own project aside it seems somewhat draconian to disallow any third party apps from competing with the built in apps ,0
796,879_3, Just looking at the list of reserved file types seems like all file types known to man are reserved ,0
797,879_4, And then I remind myself that this is just on the SD card ,0
798,879_5, But then what is the point of the SD card if the developer is restricted to the phone is internal memory ,0
799,879_6, We cannot read more ,0
800,879_7, There is SSL TLS socket support in Windows Phone ,0
801,879_8, However currently no WP platform component seems to support SSL certificate pinning ,0
802,879_9, When a SSL connection is created there is no way to inspect the x certificate chain returned by the remote server ,0
803,880_1, I want to implement certificate pinning for additional security in my app and therefore I need an API to read the values of individual x certificates ,1
804,880_2, I am not the only one who needs this url Please provide a way to do certificate pinning using platform components in WP ,0
805,880_3, This is third time I am stuck in windows phone app development because windows phone does not provide a good background service ,0
806,881_1, Running of background service just for seconds every minutes is restricting app developers from creating required apps for clients ,0
807,881_2, My client is a well known home appliances manufacturing company and they insist on regular update from app even when app is not running which we successfully implemented in Android and iOS ,0
808,881_3, But because of the restriction in windows phone development over background service client is on the verge of dropping windows phone app for their product ,0
809,881_4, So what I suggest is give flexible background service for development and notify user while installing the app about the background services that will be running and battery consumption it might cause And then user can decide to install the app or not ,1
810,881_5, But because of the restriction in windows phone development over background service client is on the verge of dropping windows phone app for more ,0
811,881_6, few days before updating the latest Windows app studio I can still install into my Phone ,0
812,881_7, But after this new version and generation into WP and W I manage once with success installation but NOW can not be installed and always asked for install from STORE ,0
813,881_8, it will be great if APP can access files in Documents dir ,1
814,881_9, currently APP can only access them through Office ,0
815,881_10, that made all document viewing editing APP has a terrible user experience ,0
816,881_11, and user may not understand how to open some type of files ,0
817,881_12, if the Microsoft force users to use Office or force developers to use SkyDrive by this way may take the opposite result and lost users and developers ,0
818,882_1, It would be greater if we could disable the close function while doing important tasks like writing to the storage or similar ,1
819,883_1, However if the user closes the app during these processes the data might be corrupted ,0
820,883_2, Or for instance we are in a setup wizard we do not want the user to be able to close the app until the user has finished the setup ,0
821,883_3, error report ,0
822,883_4, I created my app in windows phone app studio ,0
823,884_1, I choose in my phone the white theme and I see a problem The hidden menu does not show anything ,0
824,884_2, When I choose black theme I can see all options in hidden menu ,0
825,884_3, I do not know how to change this to make this works properly ,0
826,884_4, ,0
827,884_5, Some excellent tools to help find good cellular service like GSM Monitor are not currently supported due to lack of an api to support the raw cellular data in real time ,0
828,884_6, Would be good if some of these tools could be developed by the support of cellular data in the network api ,1
829,884_7, Simply like in a Windows ,0
830,884_8, Have an API for an application to interact with and listen for incomming connections from paired bluetooth devices while in background ,1
831,884_9, One possible use case A smart watch that uses the phone as a way to access information in the internet ,0
832,884_10, For the most time the watch is disconnected from the phone but from time to time it could connect to a service running on the phone maybe timed maybe because user presses a button on the phone to send a request which the service on the phone then handles some additional data transfer between the phone and watch and the phone and some cloud service may be involved The actual trigger from device to phone could be done with Bluetooth LE if listening for incomming SPP connections is too much of a drain as long as it would be possible for an application to do some background processing and data transfer based on triggers comming from external hardware accessories ,1
833,884_12, Not being able to compile shaders at runtime is a huge inconvenience and prevents projects like ANGLE from producing a fully compliant OpenGL port ,0
834,884_13, Please provide a API to get the signal strength of a particular Bluetooth device so that we can estimate the distance between Windows Phone and the device ,1
835,884_14, This can help us implement positioning in a small aera which just like what Apple iBeacon does ,0
836,885_1, It is interesting and useful ,0
837,886_1, Silverlight does not work properly in IE so I cannot upload xap files using IE ,0
838,886_2, I have to switch to google Chrome to publish Windows Phone Apps ,0
839,888_1, I get the following message You do not have a supported version of silverlight installed ,0
840,889_1, To get the latest version ,0
841,889_2, If I try to update silverlight I recieve the message The same version is already installed ,0
842,889_3, Silverlight is enabled etc ,0
843,889_4, Application that will silence ringer between set hours but allow exceptions by contact and silence ringer during scheduled meetings from my linked calendars Outlook com Google com Yahoo com etc ,0
844,889_5, It looks like instances of AudioVideoCaptureDevice automatically dispose when an app is deactivated ,0
845,889_6, The disposal appears to be done in the runtime code as none of my disposal code runs in these situations ,0
846,889_7, This is an issue when the application returns to the foreground and ActivatedEventArgsIsApplicationInstancePreserved true because all application memory should be intact ,0
847,889_8, But it is not because the AudioVideoCaptureDevice instance has been auto magically disposed ,0
848,889_9, This can be difficult to detect if the device is used in a deeply embedded object ,0
849,889_10, My idea is that You are using tour own agenda and then notice the poor synchronising performance of it with Google agenda ,0
850,889_11, With other words it sucks ,0
851,890_1, Allow custom URI is in Internet Explorer like nabto 😕 device company net ,1
852,891_1, Basically implement the IInternetProtocol family of COM interfaces on Windows Phone and allow us to add our own protocol handlers in the Registry it is possible on Windows ,1
853,891_2, BatteryManager should provide mechanism to tell us whether phone is plugged in AC or using USB ,1
854,893_1, Right now it only tells me whether the battery source is External or Battery but ' external ' is too generic ,0
855,894_1, It ' ll be great to have BatterySource USB and BatterySource AC when plugged in and BatterySource Battery when not plugged in ,1
856,894_2, I recently asked myself how long an app takes to get in the store ,0
857,894_3, Especially if there are deadlines to fulfill it comes in very handy if there is a sort of progressbar indicating how many steps are necessary to get certified ,0
858,896_1, All other steps are working really smooth but the pending certification is taking up to days without showing any progress ,0
859,896_2, Is there a way to add a progress ie ,0
860,896_3, pending certification percent done in the account ,0
861,896_4, That would be very nice for all the developers out there waiting for their app so become reality ,1
862,896_5, At the moment there are only APIs for reading and writing NFC Tags ,0
863,896_6, Unfortunately this is only a very small part of the NFC capabilities ,0
864,896_7, With an ISO Smartcard support you would be able to communicate with Smartcards like being used in public transport or supporting payment via NFC Credit Cards ,0
865,896_8, These capabilities are well supported by other platforms and I would like to see this support on WP too ,0
866,896_9, Have you ever decided not to download an app while browsing the store simply because it did not have any ratings or reviews ,0
867,896_10, If so then this issue should concern you as a developer ,0
868,896_11, The app store currently only shows consumers app ratings and reviews in the country that you live in ,0
869,896_12, So for example if an app is published in Canada and the United States and only the users in Canada leave a rating reviews then the users in the United States will not see those ratings and could potentially decide not to download the app ,0
870,896_13, This also gives the false impression that your app is not good even though you know that people worldwide are enjoying or not enjoying the app ,0
871,896_14, So I am suggesting that Microsoft implement a system to show a consumer all the ratings and reviews ,1
872,896_15, I understand there may be some issues with language etc ,0
873,896_16, and an easy way to implement is to do this asides from Bing Translating Wonderful App Name user reviews worldwide reviews in your market This way a user can toggle between the world and local reviews ,0
874,896_17, Ratings and Reviews are an important part of an app store otherwise why would Microsoft bother having them ,0
875,896_18, Ratings and Reviews are an important part of a developers promotion arsenal after all who would you rather believe the seller is ads or user reviews of the app ,0
876,896_19, Not all of us are the Instagrams of the world and depend on each and every ratings we can get ,0
877,896_20, So if you think it is only fair that users see all the reviews in the app store then please support this request by voting for it ,0
878,896_21, This also gives the more ,0
879,896_22, The idea is to install partially or all the data of the application to cloud services and not to the local device ,0
880,896_23, Currently there are no reports to show the purchases or downloads in real time as and when it happens ,0
881,896_24, This reduces the transparency as well as ability to verify transaction ,0
882,896_25, This is one of the important feature required in Windows Phone dev report ,0
883,897_1, remove the lock screen and make it a notifications screen where you can see everything that happened until interacted with on the phone by simply pressing the lock button on this screen and the logo of the application of the Communication provides a small preview of a soft black and white and also allow us to access it only touched his notice ,1
884,898_1, this implied that background applications in some cas updated costatemete si presents many notifications have an application that only the logo appears and the number of requests for this application ,0
885,898_2, We can get the contact s details First Name Last Name Image Email ID Mobile Number etc stored in the phone but not the group details like Group Name Member Count Member Name s ,0
886,898_3, For a phone hear and function called main so I need the driver API and identify the data call Recording For example Get the phone number to call to display information based on the number of phone customers prepare for new sales transactions over the phone ,1
887,898_4, A virtual android application that allows the end user to play and install android apps on a windows phone within the app ,0
888,898_5, Update the WPDEV feedback app ,1
889,899_1, I want to communicate with the sensors in my app when phone is in standby mode ,0
890,899_2, BlackBerry has an Android runtime that can be used to run Android apk files and developers can port their Android app to the BB OS ,0
891,900_1, I think Windows Phone should make that happen in conjunction with their supporting Xamarin and potentially hire me as a developer to help ,1
892,900_2, Would like to change the view of the contact being displayed ,1
893,900_3, In the current view I can hardly see the contact number or anything that I would like to focus ,0
894,902_1, If there is a way to change the Data Template for the list and details of a contact that would be great ,0
895,902_2, Also I would like to add more extension points to the Contact Details that are currently captured ,1
896,902_3, That I suppose is currently not possible ,0
897,903_1, forex trading platform to windows mobile ,0
898,903_2, Currently there does not seem to be any possibility to disable the bounce effect when scrolling inside the WebBrowser control which makes any apps based in HTML look and feel cheap ,0
899,904_1, This happens when you try to scroll beyond the bounds of the control and there is the elastic effect which allows you to move the page beyond the border of the control ,0
900,904_2, Would it be possible to disable this ,0
901,905_1, The software should allow JavaScript to be used through internet explorer ,1
902,906_1, As website is cant use lightbox ,0
903,906_2, Ie Littlewoods etc item images ,0
904,906_3, Skype contacts are cluttering up my people app and the only way I have found to delete them is to delete them on my desktop and then reset my phone to factory defaults ,0
905,907_1, We need to be able to use third party Bluetooth equipment ,1
906,907_2, At least do file transfer and keyboards like everyone else ,0
907,907_3, Above could save hours spent on reading wrong answers ,0
908,907_4, From an old suggestion which got declined Phone off locked Reminder comes up reminder is setup to open the owner app when tapped User taps over reminder then unlocks target app is not launched Expected Tapping over the reminder and then unlocking should take the user to the target app just as it works when the phone is unlocked and a reminder pops up ,0
909,907_5, See url I really hope Microsoft can resolve this issue because it is clearly a bug and it definitely does not work as designed ,0
910,907_6, I can understand that tapping on the reminder cannot take me to the app if the screen is locked but at least give me a possibility to unlock the screen ,1
911,907_7, Currently the only options I have is to close the reminder by tapping the snooze or ignore or the back button ,0
912,907_8, If this is working as designed then I thing the NavigationUri in the Reminder is unnecessary and should be marked obsolete or the documentation should be updated with a limitations on the lock screen ,1
913,908_1, Furthermore without any scientific proofs I assume most reminders will arrive when the screen is locked so why have a feature that can only work for a fraction of the time ,0
914,909_1, I can understand that tapping on the reminder more ,0
915,909_2, Please do not Kill ram devices in the future with new update Also ios still use full mhz cpu and it is still good Use some file paging on internal rom but do not Kill the performance please ,1
916,909_3, My internet explorer has stopped working ,0
917,909_4, Change the sound for typing ,0
918,909_5, My Nokia screen was unresponsive along with the screen buttons ,0
919,909_6, I had to hold power button with volume down button in order to shut device off and reboot ,0
920,909_7, Upon reboot the screen and screen buttons are now responsive again ,0
921,909_8, This is the third time in the past months I have encountered this problem ,0
922,909_9, Allow downloading of submissioned xap files in Windows Phone application publish submission process ,1
923,909_10, Currently you can add delete and replace file but cannot download xap file for easy re editing unzip modify zip after failed certification test or whatever other purpose ,0
924,909_11, It is impossible to manage even a hanging indent because Paragraph lacks Margin and TextIndent properties ,0
925,909_12, However hacking a hanging indent is not the real goal general support for bulleting ,0
926,909_13, Build support for bullets and numbering into the Paragraph class with properties something like this NumberStart int inherit from previous run NumberStyle enum None Bullet Arabic Letter Roman NumberFlags enum flags UpperCase DottedLevels NumberLevel int Make NumberStyle default to None and all this is non breaking ,1
927,910_1, Provide an api to list all the installed applications in a wp device This functionality can be enable once the user enroll successfully through company app ,1
928,910_2, As a musician I often get mp is attached in e mails when we are in the process of recording mixing and editing music ,0
929,910_3, I can only play them from the e mail directly but it is not possible to save them to your phone memory ,0
930,911_1, Would be nice if that was possible ,1
931,911_2, There is no serious TFS application on Windows Phone Store ,0
932,911_3, Please give us API for TFS so we can connect to TFS server see all our projects and users manage tasks manage code versioning and etc ,1
933,911_4, This is must have for a development tool ,0
934,911_5, Recently I read about new WinPhone features and one of the which had took my attention is the notification area ,0
935,911_6, I think you need to make a different notification area ,1
936,911_7, On the WinPho video it works like Android and iOS ,0
937,911_8, You pull from the top to down and the notification area appears ,0
938,911_9, Why do not you use the WinPho style ,1
939,911_10, For example to show the notification area you swipe from left to right ,0
940,911_11, When a notification appears you have options swipe it from the left to right and brings the notifications area or swipe the notification from bottom to up to ignore it or press it to open the application related to the notification ,0
941,911_12, This notification in my opinion will make WinPho stills a different OS from Android and iOS ,0
942,911_13, I hope to contribute to a new vanguardist and different operational system in my smartphone ,0
943,911_14, I hope you like it ,0
944,911_15, Thank you and best regards ,0
945,911_16, When a notification appears you have options swipe it from the left to right and brings the notifications area or swipe the notification from bottom to more ,0
946,912_1, Facebook for WinPho needs better integration with Facebook ,1
947,1205_2, It would be extremely helpful if the emulator could use webcams as camera emulation ,1
948,1205_3, Otherwise AR scenarios are hard to develop without a range of devices ,0
949,1206_1, It has become even more needed with the addition of WXGA and the different scalings in WP ,0
950,1207_1, Improve microsoft account login usability in app ,1
951,1207_2, Choose to login automatically with your microsoft account saved into phone also win RT without insert login and password again ,0
952,1208_1, It is so boring that you need do that also for microsoft apps like photosynth and skype ,0
953,1208_2, I just want to tell you that it will be good if you give option to lock the applications specifically like sms ,1
954,1208_3, tl dr Creating a popular app is a bit of a chicken and egg problem ,0
955,1209_1, It would be great to see this circumvented somehow ,1
956,1210_1, One possibility Instead of having a top charts style listing where the most popular apps are displayed to every phone anywhere create a new form of distribution where the results are randomized every time a user looks at the marketplace ,1
957,1210_2, Now that obviously has the result of bad apps being near the top a lot so you modify that with ratings ,0
958,1211_1, Highly rated apps should appear near the top more and they should appear less and less frequently and the rating of the app dwindles ,1
959,1212_1, For example my app is currently fairly well reviewed stars ,0
960,1212_2, However it NEVER gets good visibility because it is not the best which is actually subject to a very wide variety of opinions ,0
961,1212_3, It seems to me that all good apps games should have a chance at decent exposure in the top charts and waiting to be featured just is not worth it ,1
962,1212_4, Another option is to do this with the featured apps in the marketplace ,1
963,1212_5, Instead of ten featured games per day which all users see it would be better for each user to see a random set of games each time the marketplace is viewed ,1
964,1213_1, In this way every decent game would get a considerable amount of exposure each day while apps that had a rough beginning could mend their flaws and become successful apps ,0
965,1214_1, There are a lot of reasons why this might be difficult but I feel that with a little bit of thought this could be a very profitable idea both for developers and for Microsoft ,1
966,1214_2, My two cents ,0
967,1214_3, Highly rated apps should appear near the top more and they should appear less and less more ,1
968,1214_4, Import alert tones ,0
969,1214_5, need an API to hide cprog exe and bring other application to front ground ,1
970,1214_6, Please implement style triggers for Windows Phone XAML BAML ,1

972,1215_1, As an app seller I have to deal with dissatisfied customers ever once in a while ,0
973,1215_2, I want to be able to refund a purchase that a customer made both in app products and paid downloads ,1
974,1216_1, I need a way to remove files from my WP device which have been disliked ,1
975,1216_2, Since apps are not allowed to modify files on sd cards I wanted to write a desktop sync app that would examine the device for any files that have been disliked and then remove them ,0
976,1216_3, However this is impossible with all existing API is ,0
977,1217_1, If I have an app that shows a filtered subset of a user is contacts I should have a way to click on that user and show the user is details in the native experience ,1
978,1217_2, I am familiar with the suggestion to take the contact is details and re create them in your own UI which would be great if the API exposed all of the user is details like the Anniversary which it does not ,0
979,1218_1, Also having a ShowContactTask would allow me to give my user a quick shortcut to post a message on Twitter or Facebook without having to implement those SDKs especially since the APIs do not currently give you access to social networking contacts to be able to pull their social network handles ,0
980,1219_1, Also having a ShowContactTask would allow me to give my user a quick shortcut to post a message on Twitter or Facebook without having to implement those SDKs especially more ,0
981,1219_2, OCR Sample App Using Project Hawaii OCR API ,0
982,1219_3, A sample project for using Hawaii OCR API would be very helpful for the developers Also need help with how to use image pre processing techniques and supported image processing libraries on WP to improve OCR accuracy ,1
983,1220_1, I recently submitted an app but the process hung when I clicked Submit ,0
984,1221_1, I went through the whole process again but received the message that the alias was already in use ,0
985,1222_1, Thinking this meant that my app name was already being used by someone else I changed the name slightly ,0
986,1222_2, This submission went through smoothly ,0
987,1222_3, I later found that the original submission had also been successful even though it had hung so that there were now two duplicate submissions in Processing Certification with slightly different aliases ,0
988,1223_1, I wanted to delete the extra one but but could not ,0
989,1224_1, I could only change it to Manually Publish and hope to delete it later ,0
990,1225_1, It would be much preferable to remove it from the Certificatio nprocess ,1
991,1225_2, I could only more ,0
992,1226_1, Currently we have Access to external mass storage ,0
993,1227_1, Please provide Access to internal too ,1
994,1227_2, Currently the only way to upload the user files to the ISO storage is to use the cloud like services Skydrive ,0
995,1227_3, It does not make a sense when the large multimedia files have to be transferred You first have to transfer them up to Skydrive and then download to phone ,0
996,1227_4, It would be great if the part of the application ISO store could be made visible in the Windows File Explorer when the phone is connected by the USB cable ,0
997,1228_1, Currently only the media library is visible in this way and the access to the media library from app is very limited ,0
998,1228_2, Currently only the media library is visible in this way and the access to the media library from app is more ,0
999,1228_3, I liked Android and now bought HTC s with a GB microSD to find out that App to SD is not supported ,0
1000,1228_4, I know that the Copyright for Apps schouldn ' t been touched but what about the App to internal Memory and the needed files to microSD to Support Phones with short internal Memory ,0
1001,1228_5, Today is world where Java is every where I do not know why WP does not support java based applications and why Microsoft have not provided any way to develop WP applications in Java ,0
1002,1228_6, Please expose the ID property for Contacts and Appointments ,1
1003,1228_7, At the moment it is private and inaccessible via Reflection because of trust levels which makes unique contact appointment identification impossible ,0
1004,1228_8, Any application that might want to back up contact appointments and thus would need to differentiate between entities via a unique identifier cannot exist ,0
1005,1228_9, Please take this into consideration and make the ID public maybe with a new capability requirement ,1
1006,1228_10, Language problem ,0
1007,1229_1, If a ListBox has elements with different sizes and you call ScrollIntoView to the last Item the ScrollViewer does not scroll to correct position ,0
1008,1229_2, You can reproduce it adding rectangles with px px and px of height and calling ScrollIntoView to the last item ,0
1009,1230_1, Now on Windows Phone when we have resolutions taking screenshots may take a lot of time ,0
1010,1231_1, You have to run one emulator take screenshots close it and run another and so on ,0
1011,1231_2, We can scale wxga to wvga it still requires some work because they have the same ratio but we can not do this with p ,0
1012,1231_3, Emulators are even slower than the WP ones so the process is really long ,0
1013,1231_4, Consider also option where you have application in several languages ,0
1014,1232_1, You have to take screenshots in one language change it to another wait until emulator reloads and so on ,0
1015,1232_2, It takes a lot of time ,0
1016,1233_1, I would like to ask Microsoft to give us a tool option in emulator with which we can take screenshots once in one emulator and it will produce screenshots in all resolutions and all languages supported by our app ,1
1017,1234_1, It would save us a lot of time ,0
1018,1234_2, You have to take screenshots in one language change it to another wait until emulator reloads and so on more ,0
1019,1235_1, There is an very old bug that is still present in Windows Phone SDK when a page has a control that inherits from ToggleButton for example CheckBox System IO FileNotFoundException is thrown and shown in the Debug output ,0

1022,1236_1, Which I am able to do on iOS Android and J ME platforms ,0
1023,1236_2, So something like PeerFinder AlternateIdentities Bluetooth UnPaired ,0
1024,1237_1, A developer should have the possibility to write his own complete implementation of background audio player or the built in one should at least provide the possibility of gapless playback or changing audio title album without pausing playback ,1
1025,1237_2, AS developing XNA apps in Windows Phone development will not be supported anymore we sometimes need to have d Models and work with them inside application without need to learn C Direct X which will take alot of time and maybe valuable for game developers only ,0
1026,1237_3, so we need aupport for such feature in XAML Code like in SilverLight ,1
1027,1238_1, I want to create a app for incoming call recording but WP not provide any API for do this ,0
1028,1238_2, Also need API for voice record with background agent ,1
1029,1238_3, Provide API to easy save settings of an app online and restore after unnstall or reset change phone using a Microsoft account url and online service skydrive azure ,1
1030,1239_1, Allow users to take screenshots when the phone is muted without sound ,1
1031,1240_1, In WP the default Pivot control now correctly displays the title text at the top of the page with the PhoneFontFamilySemiBold and PhoneFontSizeMedium styles but the standard blank page template still uses PhoneTextNormalStyle which uses the normal font weight and a slightly smaller size for the page title ,0
1032,1240_2, These page templates should be updated to use the medium sized semibold font by default for the title text ,1
1033,1240_3, This change would encourage consistency with both the apps built in to the OS and within an app itself ,0
1034,1241_1, This should also be fixed in the WP SDK where all page templates including the Pivot template still use PhoneTextNormal style for the title ,1
1035,1241_2, This should also be fixed in the WP SDK where all page templates including the Pivot more ,1
1036,1242_1, Haciendo que el celular del lumia se pueda utilizar como almacenamiento masivo como cualquier otro celular emsad ,0
1037,1243_1, Currently Microsoft Phone Info DeviceStatus is available to know the device manufacturer and it is only accesible from C # project making it a round way about to include this project in C managed code ,0
1038,1244_1, It would be helpful if we have an equivalent API available in C ,1
1039,1244_2, If you are browsing web in your app and you reach a site protected by basic auth the control stops working ,0
1040,1244_3, It fires the navigating event but not the navigated event ,0
1041,1244_4, Seems that it is waiting to receive credential but no popup is showed ,0
1042,1244_5, After this the control is no more usable the only option is to close the application and reload all ,0
1043,1244_6, Allow a user to change the ring tone or sound of new txt messages coming to the phone ,1
1044,1245_1, After the to update I was so thankful that the arrow icon the arrow that takes you to the apps page even though you can just swipe the page ,0
1045,1245_2, was taken off to leave more room for the icons on the homescreen ,0
1046,1245_3, However there is still a mm gap at the top of the page not including the space for the time etc that is wasteful ,0
1047,1246_1, Can you get rid of this space to enable more icons to fit to the homescreen ,1
1048,1247_1, It is so annoying ,0
1049,1247_2, Add a Boolean to the CameraCaptureTask to optionally add the picture taken to the Camera Roll ,1

1053,1251_1, It is not exposed by the SDK please fix it ,1
1054,1252_1, We need a way to save videos to the camera roll ,1
1055,1252_2, The leak of a MediaLibrary SaveVideo method makes third party video apps very uncomfortable for the user ,0
1056,1252_3, it will be gode to can add custom sound to Toas notifications ,1
1057,1252_4, If we can see the current voltage level we can determine if the phone is plugged in to USB power or utilizing an induction charger ,0
1058,1252_5, Certain WP phones have wireless or inductive charging and we need to be able to calculate the efficiency of these chargers ,0
1059,1252_6, A thick phone case or simply not centering the phone on the charging plate can result in reduced charging capacity and much longer charging times ,0
1060,1252_7, Adding visbility to the battery mAh would then allow battery health apps charger comparisons and inductive charger efficiency or inneficiency ,0
1061,1253_1, For example allowing the user to view the time it would take to reach full charge on USB vs induction ,1
1062,1254_1, Please add the capability to view voltage and mAh or if possible another method to check if the device is charging with USB power or wireless power ,1
1063,1254_2, For example allowing the user to view the time more ,1
1064,1255_1, We need different sound levels sound level for system for alarm clock for music radio and different for keyboard ,1
1065,1255_2, I want to have sounds enabled to keyboard but not at highest level also i want to listen to radio throuth the night and be sure that the next morning the alarm clock will sound as high as possible to wake me up ,1

1068,1257_1, Reminder api only allows the developer to repeat at least once in a day ,0
1069,1257_2, It would be nice to schedule a reminder to repeat at X hours ,1
1070,1257_3, Currently it is impossible to pause in in progress BackgroundTransferRequest ,0
1071,1258_1, This would be beneficial for apps where multiple downloads may be running at once and the user wants to optimise the order in which they download ,0
1072,1258_2, The majority of apps I see at the marketplace does not have any review is ,0
1073,1259_1, I think that has an overall negative effect user wise community wise and dev wise Maybe you should think about some way to reward those users who take their time to actually try an app and review it ,0
1074,1260_1, I know that thinking up such a system is not easy as you would have to think carefully about abuses ,0
1075,1260_2, There is currently no indication that an application is being featured it would be nice to receive a email prior to it being featured to indicate what dates countries it will be featured in ,0
1076,1260_3, So we can see all our emails in single app ,0
1077,1261_1, I think that there should be a nice feature were you can be able to slide the status bar down and view all the push notifications that you got but you did not view just like android and IOS but the best part is that it fixes many problems like when people wanted a short cut to turn WiFi on and off and data on and off so that would be a nice feature to have ,1
1078,1261_2, I strongly think that more background color is should be there like instead of just black and white have blue red green and stuff like that and more accent colors ,1
1079,1261_3, Keep tiles ,0
1080,1262_1, Make it so the Xbox app has smart glass in it without having to install the app directly but put the games in a different folder ,1
1081,1263_1, Better music player I like the Zune on interface or Xbox music interface but I would like it so you can do more customization with it and have it so we can move a scroller on the bar that tells you how many minutes have you been playing the song so that we can skip through the music to our favorite part ,1
1082,1263_2, Better people app I like the people app with the UI and the Facebook twitter LinkedIn integration but the thing I would like most is if you made the top thing that said people was a smaller text it take to much space on the app ,1
1083,1264_1, Make it so the tiles can be see through and the background can be a background image that would look nice ,1
1084,1264_2, Better marketplace I would like a new UI ,1
1085,1264_3, Keyboard is nice but when you do landscape mode on the keyboard the whole screen is not covered by the keyboard the status bar sort of shortens the keyboard so it would be nice if the status bar did not interfere ,0
1086,1264_4, Mobile teethering I WOULD APPRECIATE THIS TO BE ON A NEW WP UPDATE FOR WP AND WP BUT WOULD BE FINE ,1
1087,1264_5, I strongly think that more background color is should be there like instead of just black and white have blue red green and stuff more ,1
1088,1264_6, In our video conferencing app network access seems to get shut down for a couple of sec approx ,0
1089,1264_7, every sec ONLY when subscribed to Geolocator is StatusChanged PositionChanged works fine otherwise ,0
1090,1264_8, Does this have anything to do with wifi being one of location sources ,0
1091,1265_1, Is there any way to select a location source s to use like on other platforms ,0
1092,1265_2, Some especially for mobile useful CSS features like ms scroll chaining snap points and several others are missing from the phone version of ie which cripples the touch experience and requires additional and less smooth js libraries ,0
1093,1265_3, It is especially frustrating while developing native html based apps ,0
1094,1267_1, Please make an option like windows phone to mark several messages at the time of deletion As tapping and holding of every message and deleting take more time and it makes angry ,1
1095,1267_2, Please make an option to mark messages for windows phone ,1
1096,1268_1, Allow the use of desktop keyboard to interact with WP emulator similar to the current mouse functionality ,1
1097,1268_2, Wish there was a way for mails contacts calendars etc to be pulled from an OWA URL into the email account definitions ,1
1098,1269_1, BB has this as a standard feature out of the box while rd party apps are available under IOS though not half as good as the BB ,0
1099,1269_2, This is particularly helpful when activesync has not been enabled ,0
1100,1269_3, If the information is available from a browser it should be available to an app ,0
1101,1269_4, I want to be nice about this one but seriously ,0
1102,1270_1, Why is it impossible to get the Contact designated by the system as Me for the purposes of getting my current Picture ,0
1103,1270_2, Why should I have to implement a ContactPicker to make the user choose or implement the Live SDK and force them to log in when the phone already knows ,0
1104,1271_1, I understand the reasoning for not allowing the user to have access to the Mailboxes in the phone but there should be an API to enumerate through accounts and get their statistics like the number of unread emails number of important emails and the total e mail count ,1
1105,1271_2, There are more and more external sensors not only medical but all kind of proximity stuff for watches smart apliances cars and innumerable industrial applications that would pen the door to thousands of new apps ,0
1106,1271_3, As usual Microsoft is late in this too and so we have to focus development on iOS and android that have the SDK up to date with technology ,0
1107,1272_1, App will not upload photos ,0
1108,1272_2, Only video ,0
1109,1273_1, We use Microsoft Expression Encoder to do live smooth streaming video feeds ,0
1110,1273_2, I was surprised to find that the built in media player does not support the HTML video element and live streaming ,0
1111,1273_3, video src url It works on iOS Android and Apple computers with Safari ,0
1112,1273_4, Since this is a Microsoft technology or at least I thought it was I figured it would work wonderfully on Window Phone ,0
1113,1273_5, I can use a Silverlight player program BitGravity Player is what I am currently using but it requires me to type an address in ,0
1114,1273_6, It is just one area that I can not recommend Windows Phones to people ,0
1115,1273_7, I used to be able to recommend Windows Mobile phones because we used Windows Media Streaming Server and it had Windows Media Player ,0
1116,1273_8, It is just one area that I can not recommend more ,0
1117,1273_9, You can retweet and answer Tweets but You cant favorite ,0
1118,1273_10, The restrictions on the calendar edit delete are rediculous ,0
1119,1273_11, Let the user decide if an app should have access to calendar files ,0
1120,1273_12, This rigid rule makes it impossible to make a functional rd party calendar app ,0
1121,1273_13, Look at how much Week Calendar from Utilitap have improved iOS for several years before they made a better iCalendar app ,0
1122,1273_14, I had decided to buy a WP phone but aslong as the calendar lacks so many functions and there is no hope of a better rd party app I will stick with iOS or possibly Android ,0
1123,1273_15, This is the most important feature lacking in WP ,0
1124,1273_16, By far ,0
1125,1273_17, This is the most important feature lacking in more ,0
1126,1273_18, Let battery more efficient and alarm can work if the phone turned off ,0
1127,1273_19, That last update at the end of date made the touch responsiveness on my Nokia much worse ,0
1128,1273_20, the phone jumps to other pages when I am scrolling up and down ,0
1129,1273_21, Wish I can undo that patch ,1
1130,1273_22, This would open the way for developers to create applications that will allow users to add unique colors to customize their device ,0
1131,1273_23, This is not about just having more colors in the them colors dialog but being able as a developer ,0
1132,1273_24, to add more colors to that list from your app ,0
1133,1274_1, Windows Phone includes a new Map control ,0
1134,1274_2, It has a new feature to add a route that will be displayed under street names ,0
1135,1274_3, Street names over the route will be shown in another color and are moved to stay always in center ,0
1136,1274_4, To add a route to the map you have to create MapRoute object that accepts only Route object in it is constructor ,0
1137,1274_5, But Route object does not have public constructor ,0
1138,1274_6, The only possibility to create Route is RouteQuery class ,0
1139,1275_1, This is a problem ,0
1140,1276_1, RouteQuery uses online service to calculate the route ,0
1141,1276_2, Apps can not show the traveled route at real time on the map like jogging apps ,0
1142,1276_3, Because they would have to be always online and query the online service frequently ,0
1143,1277_1, It is possible to workaround this with MapPolyline ,0
1144,1277_2, But the polyline is shown OVER the street names ,0
1145,1277_3, Street names color stays black and not being centered ,0
1146,1277_4, Also if the new Map has route feature it should be usable ,1
1147,1277_5, Possible solution Route class implements IRoutePath ,0
1148,1277_6, MapRoute constructor should accept IRoutePath inteface instead of Route class ,0
1149,1277_7, Apps can not show the traveled route at more ,0
1150,1277_8, The Contact class is missing at least one data point the Anniversary ,0
1151,1277_9, Please make sure that any data accessible from the Contact Details page is made available to the Contact class ,1
1152,1277_10, Other folder continues to grow till phone storage is full ,0
1153,1277_11, Now uninstalling apps also is not of much use a reset needs to be done ,0
1154,1277_12, When Skype replaces Messenger do not forget wp users background push messaging ,0
1155,1277_13, Improve it is data base and functionality ,1

1503,1476_1, This is very limited and also time consuming ,0
1504,1476_2, Ideally a company may wish to dedicate a group of Live IDs as testers to be used each time ,0

1851,1689_10, So if we need a specific part of the address we would have to do some fairly tricky parsing ,0
1852,1689_11, It would be nice if we had finer access so we could specifically get say the postcode ,1
1853,1689_12, When entering address details for a contact the address details are split into different fields anyway so one would expect to be able to access them individually from the result an AddressChooserTask as well ,0

2034,1740_2, Today application are achieving this by embedding browser control which is not a good expereince for end user ,0
2035,1740_3, Since the Screen times out after option has the maximum time for only minute and as a consumer perspective it is okay but for a developer this feature is very annoying when we debug our apps on the device and the Visual Studio shows the message like The application could not be launched for debugging ,0
2036,1741_1, Ensure that the target device screen is unlocked and that the application is installed ,1

2050,1742_2, Rating is an int variable and I want to be able to specify an exact value ,1

2059,1746_1, Zunes could do it so why did the Audible support get dropped before WP ,0

2067,1748_4, Provide access to the podcast episodes that are in the media library so that they may be used to construct for instance custom playlists ,1
2068,1748_5, Developers wishing to leverage the Zune media platform to offer improved or tailored podcast playback experiences are currently blocked ,0
2069,1748_6, Instead an app developer must re implement all the podcast management functions that are already well handled by the device and the computer Zune software ,0
2070,1749_1, Once access to a user s podcast subscriptions and already downloaded episodes is enabled developers may easily write applications which enhance the existing playback experience ,0
2071,1749_2, This idea could be relatively simply achieved as a new Podcast genre however that would negatively impact those existing applications which are written with the expectation that all of a user s genres are musical other than the Ringtone genre ,0
2072,1749_3, A better implementation might expose a new property or method on MediaLibrary that provides access to a podcast subscription management and episode access object ,0

2082,1749_13, Mango provides a good feature to scan an image for a text ,0
2083,1749_14, It would be great to provide a new launcher task which uses this new existing funtionality to get a string from an image ,1
2084,1750_1, Otherwise we need to create our own control to scan an image and extract strings with an ocr library ,0
2085,1750_2, I am not happy to implement something which is already there ,0
2086,1750_3, Even if this API would use a webservice and needs network access I would be fine with that ,0
2087,1750_4, I have cribbs about the lack of file transfer over bluetooth but the inability to play video and game sounds through a bluetooth headset is very very lame ,0
2088,1751_1, I get to play music etc with by bluetooth headset ,0
2089,1752_1, the moment I open a video the sound is played back using the devices back speakers ,0
2090,1752_2, Please note yalla apps in dubai provides way to submit apps to marketplace but it is too costly for developers which takes percent commission from total income of developers and provides only one device unlock for free ,0
2091,1752_3, Also service is too slow ,0
2092,1753_1, You are running an application that records your GPS position after traveling so many feet ,0
2093,1753_2, If for some reason your application gets deactivated you receive a phone call your recorded track will be missing data for the time you were on the phone ,0
2094,1754_1, This can be a serious problem if you need to follow the track back out ,0
2095,1754_2, What this forces the user to do is carry a hand held GPS as well as a phone when the track log is important ,0
2096,1755_1, Microsoft Xna Framework Media MediaPlayer Queue Activesong populates the Artist property for music streamed from Zune but not the Name property so devs can not know what song is playing ,0
2097,1756_1, Marketplace policy requires music apps to populate both properties so Zune should do this too ,0
2098,1757_1, Ability to create scheduled tasks that occur at a given interval ,0
2099,1757_2, Regardless of the state of the phone ,0
2100,1759_1, ie like Windows scheduled tasks or linux cron jobs ,0
2101,1759_2, I would like to schedule a job to ' POST ' a url every min to keep alive UNTANGLE authentication ,1
2102,1760_1, Currently Periodic tasks have a min limit Push Notifications will not wake up the phone ,0
2103,1760_2, This is possible on Android and iOS ,0
2104,1760_3, Git Subversion Eclipse NetBeans IDE Visual Studio Express for Windows Phone ,0
2105,1760_4, MediaElement HTTP Cookie MediaElement CookieContainer ,0
2106,1760_5, Android ,0
2107,1760_6, The general concept of a ResourceIntensiveTask being launched when constraints are met is strong but the implementation could be greatly improved ,1
2108,1760_7, Some RITs resource intensive tasks do not require comms and it is absurd to wait for connection to WiFi prior to running them ,0
2109,1760_8, Some RITs that ARE comms intensive might use the mobile carrier anyway at user discretion ,0
2110,1760_9, Some power hungry tasks are high priority and should run as soon as external power is available not wait an hour while the battery charges to percent ,0
2111,1760_10, Some tasks need to run frequently for very short periods ,0
2112,1760_11, For example logging GPS position for a tracking application with vehicle power supplied to the phone would run for sec every sec with another background task running every min for perhaps sec to send the batched data to a webservice ,0
2113,1760_12, For example logging GPS more ,0
2114,1760_13, SSDP used in UPnP relies on UDP multicast for discovery ,0
2115,1760_14, Currently UdpAnySourceMulticastClient allows for the listening to existing SSDP traffic as well as sending a solicitation M SEARCH out requesting that UPnP devices advertise themselves to the solicitor ,0
2116,1761_1, When a device replies to the M SEARCH message it sends a unicast message to the IP port that the M SEARCH message was sent from ,0
2117,1761_2, There is no way for a WP application using UdpAnySourceMulticastClient or Socket to listen on the correct port thus requiring a great deal of time to be spent in any UPnP application when doing device discovery ,0
2118,1761_3, Proper socket support a fixed UdpAnySourceMulticastClient implementation or an explicit SSDP client which supports sending handling replies to M SEARCH messages should be enabled ,1
2119,1761_4, Proper socket more ,0
2120,1761_5, Please provide an API that provides access to the texts to allow developers to implement an application to enable scenarios such as reading or archiving SMS messages ,1
2121,1762_1, ON OFF ,0
2122,1762_2, There should be an api enhancement to get access to the Me contact information or a subset of it ,1
2123,1762_3, I would especially like the name and the photo ,0
2124,1762_4, Silverlight XNA XNA TextReadtoEnd ,0
2125,1762_5, S MIME email is a mandatory requirement at my company and support for that on the Windows Phone platform is needed before we can consider it ,0
2126,1763_1, IME ,0
2127,1763_2, Local database support would be much more useful with the addition of full text search support for quickly querying large amounts of text example ,0
2128,1764_1, dictionaries ,0
2129,1764_2, Other implementations of SQL CE already support full text indexes ie ,0
2130,1764_3, through ' freetext ' and rival platforms such as Android and iOS can exploit SQLite is full text support so WP is currently at a disadvantage ,0
2131,1764_4, WAV API ,0
2132,1764_5, Easy access to the Bing Music API would be really useful especially for apps with artist song recognition ,1
2133,1765_1, Microsoft already allow developers to use the Bing Maps API in their API so i realy hope they consider opening up the Bing APIs for the coming Tango Apollo dev toolsets ,1
2134,1765_2, Would be nice to have a callback on for example the phonecalltask so that we can determine wether or not the user actually did press call or cancel ,1
2135,1766_1, Same for other tasks and launchers ,0
2136,1767_1, It would be very nice to be able to download the entire Windows Phone Tools and install it instead of having to use the web for installation ,1
2137,1767_2, I am a teacher and having to install it this way for the entire lab takes forever ,0
2138,1767_3, A event that triggers after a call has ended with Phone nr and Call Length also giving an opportunity to display an app screen ,0
2139,1768_1, Would be great for various business scenarios ,0
2140,1768_2, BingMapsDirectionsTask ,0
2141,1768_3, Just as simple as it sounds gifting an app to someone else with a Windows device ,0
2142,1769_1, Have a button which allows for purchasing and sending an app game ,1
2143,1769_2, the encrypted dabase file generated by WPDT can not be open with VS or SQL server Hope you can fix this ,0
2144,1769_3, Its funny how Zune has the ability to sort Pictures by name but when they get synced to a Windows Phone it loses that ability ,0
2145,1769_4, I really want this features because it is useful in many ways ,1
2146,1769_5, Would like to make a dialer application that would call through a list of numbers through the web notate what happened on the call keyboard or buttons then automatically launch next call ,0
2147,1769_6, This workflow sucks right now to have to confirm dialing each number ,0
2148,1769_7, Make a new setting that allows users to optin to this functionality ,1
2149,1769_8, When watching videos I do not get audio through my bluetooth headphones but I do when just listening to audio ,0
2150,1769_9, Since Microsoft have not introduced a native C SDK for WP Please create a computer emulator in C # for WP ,0
2151,1769_10, Like Qemu in Windows mobile ,0
2152,1769_11, The managed SDK should add support for using SSL client certificates for SSL Mutual Authentication in HttpWebRequest and or Web Service proxy classes ,1
2153,1769_12, Security is very important when dealing with access to sensitive data ,0
2154,1770_1, I can hear people hardly when calling mobile or landline but when calling international numbers it is just not possible to hear what people says ,0
2155,1770_2, It was bars before but with mango it became volume bars ,0
2156,1770_3, I suggest to make it back ,1
2157,1771_1, And yes I have tried different headphones and even different phones to test my operator connection quality ,0
2158,1772_1, On Android and iPhone it is fine I am even take some volume down on Android as it is too loud ,0
2159,1773_1, Can not really use my Omnia untill volume update emsad Media volume on Omnia is fine not as loud as I would prefer but good enough I can hear people hardly when calling mobile or landline but when calling international numbers it is just not possible to hear what people says ,0
2160,1774_1, Can not really use my Omnia untill volume update emsad Media volume on Omnia is fine not as loud as I more ,0

2162,1776_1, ,0
2163,1776_2, Provide a viewer for viewing office documents example ,1
2164,1776_3, word excel and powerpoint basically ,0
2165,1776_4, The UIWebView in iPhone support serveral formats and give a very good user experiences in some content related apps ,0
2166,1777_1, With WP I could view pdf and office dos with the WebBrowserTask ,0
2167,1777_2, With Mango this is not possible anymore when having one time generated urls ,0
2168,1778_1, The request is now being called twice ,0
2169,1778_2, Please fix this otherwise my and some other apps functions are not usable anymore emsad See url ,1
2170,1778_3, The idea is simple open a marketplace for developers only where devs can submit applications developed with an extended API which allows to access to more information capabilities on the device ,1
2171,1779_1, For instance texts contacts read write sockets in listening real multitasking etc We know that you released a super restricted API to avoid developing apps that could give inexpert users troubles ,0
2172,1779_2, But we developers can afford them and we can get a lot of benefits from this kind of apps ,0
2173,1779_3, ListBox ListBox P S ,0
2174,1779_4, People Hub ,0
2175,1779_5, Now in SDK it is possible to record audio by using the AudioSink Silverligh class so we do not need to trick the system by using the XNA loop but when using this class the tag Capability Name ID CAP CAMERA should be present at WMAppManifest xml file but we are only using microphone ,0
2176,1779_6, WebBrowser WriteableBitmap Web url ,0
2177,1779_7, TextBox BS Enter PasswordBox InputScope ,0
2178,1779_8, If my mobile is part of a PBX I need to transfer calls between another phones on the PBX ,0
2179,1779_9, Nowadays there is not any feature to make call forwarding call divert once I hace pick up the incoming call ,0
2180,1779_10, explorer Shield picture ,0
2181,1779_11, emailcomposetask must have html support ,0
2182,1779_12, Plain Text is not for professional apps today ,0
2183,1779_13, computerM audio encoding is the only available one it is needed to have some way to encode and compress audio to WMA MP or any encoding to allow smaller transfers when we have to send the audio to a web service ,0
2184,1779_14, At the moment the periodic task runs every minutes ,0
2185,1779_15, My suggestion is to make this interval configurable ,1
2186,1779_16, For example if you want to retrieve gelolocations frequently in the background ,0
2187,1779_17, It is just not possible to do this at the moment ,0
2188,1781_1, Other platforms iOS and Android do support this ,0
2189,1782_1, Let the user decide what he wants concerning battery life etc ,1
2190,1782_2, Do not define restrictions for developers ,1
2191,1782_3, Texture coordinate transforms are not exposed for any effects that can be used by the Reach profile even though this is something the GPyou can probably do cheaply ,0
2192,1782_4, A developer should be able to grant access to another app for data access ,0
2193,1782_5, So if an app does contacts then another app could query the contact data instead of providing it is own mechanism for contacts ,0
2194,1782_6, Pivot SelectedIndex TwoWay Pivot SelectedIndex url ,0
2195,1782_7, like Name of that caller Phone Number Etc ,0
2196,1782_8, I started as a sole developer and now there is a group of us and we are registered as a business with IRS ,0
2197,1782_9, I would like to be able to convert my individual account in the Marketplace into a company one without losing my publisher name my brand my app portfolio and my user base ,1
2198,1782_10, It is a common scenario in the real world so why should it be impossible in the Marketplace ,0
2199,1782_11, to enter just numbers with no additional simbols but and ,0
2200,1782_12, would be great a as tab to jump to the next textbox ,1
2201,1782_13, Business Apps usually have that kind of needs ,0
2202,1782_14, So I had this great idea for an app Got a good chunk of it coded then found out that SmsComposeTask does not have the ability to attach images as an MMS ,0
2203,1782_15, Is this coming in a future release ,0
2204,1783_1, Ideally EmailComposeTask would get it as well ,0
2205,1783_2, Focus mango BUG ,0
2206,1783_3, When in card view it would be great to be able to close the running application either by swiping it away using a cross to close it or whatever means as having to enter one application and pressing the back button is time consuming and sometimes annoying ,1
2207,1784_1, I would like to see the metadata be part of the project in VS ,1
2208,1784_2, This would allow as others have suggested a more streamlined process for tracking changes and perhaps even uploading a single package without having to fill in the blanks ,0
2209,1784_3, An editor like properties settings would be great ,1
2210,1784_4, ShareLinkTask and ShareStatusTask should report error or information if the user does not have a social network ,1
2211,1784_5, Launchers should have a callback that returns a string error message ,1
2212,1784_6, If the launcher is not possible a property would be useful for disabling enabling buttons that start the launchers ,0
2213,1784_7, Would like to see an improvement in MapPolyLine that allows multiple Individual Segments that have there own properties ie ,1
2214,1784_8, for example once you add a location to MapPolyLine Instance that becomes a segment I should then be able to control the look and feed such as Color of the stroke for that segment of the MapPolyLine ,1
2215,1784_9, Currently Changing the stroke changes the color for the entire line regardless of how many locations are added to the line ,0
2216,1784_10, Also would like the ability to make the Line a d gradient shape to have it pop out more on the map control ,1
2217,1784_11, I wish I could select connection speed for debugging in the emulator ,1
2218,1784_12, The android emulator can it ,0
2219,1784_13, There is one area where Mango is a retrograde step when compared with NoDo theme support ,0
2220,1784_14, In NoDo the user could leave the app switch the theme ie ,0
2221,1784_15, Dark or Light return to the app which would now in theory respect their selection ,0
2222,1784_16, In Mango the user is faced with an unholy mess because the app is only informed of the system is theme state at start up ,0
2223,1784_17, Developers have the choice of looking incompetent or ruthlessly picking a theme sticking to it thus rendering the ability to choose an overall theme pointless ,0
2224,1784_18, The SmsComposeTask does not provide any events ,0
2225,1784_19, I think we need Completed event and something like SmsResult that can be used ,1
2226,1784_20, Currently some Tasks exhibit this behaviour and some do not ,0
2227,1786_1, Please make it a standard mode of usage for each task ,1
2228,1786_2, The amount of spam applications apps that are split out into several regions ie ,0
2229,1787_1, MyTranspo series the ridiculous feed readers for all different musicians and whatnot single book applications and do nothing apps ie ,0
2230,1788_1, the stuff published by Eric rulz ,0
2231,1789_1, This is just absolutely ridiculous ,0
2232,1789_2, You already promised to take care of this but it did not work ,0
2233,1789_3, We have still useless applications flooding the Marketplace and there are no signs of it slowing ,0
2234,1790_1, I believe that instead of limiting the amount of certifications per user per day the Marketplace should be a little better curated ,1
2235,1790_2, Spam applications should not be approved ,1
2236,1791_1, They should never pass certification and should never be published ,1
2237,1792_1, Bulk publishers should be made to consolidate their apps and the rest should not pass ,1
2238,1793_1, They should more ,0
2239,1793_2, I thought I had raised this as a platform request but seems it is showing up in Feature Feedback instead ,0
2240,1794_1, Multiline text input in the current version of the platform is usable if you can work out how or be told how to do it however it is not very intuitive and I am concerned for apps that have this as a substantial feature the experience for consumers is not what it could be ,0
2241,1796_1, Current Capability for Multiline Navigation via TextBox The way it currently works is if you tap and hold you get the I cursor to appear ,0
2242,1797_1, If you entered long lines of text that take up the width of the TextBox then you will likely instinctively find you can scroll up and down through the text by dragging the cursor above and below the TextBox ,0
2243,1797_2, However if you entered shorter lines you will find that this dragging action does not work until such time as the I cursor makes contact with some text ,0
2244,1798_1, You will see it visually lock in to the text when this happens ,0
2245,1798_2, I believe this will confuse users and create unecessary friction for consumers to make use of apps that depend on multiline input that potentially is longer than displayed in half allowing for the SIP a portrait or landscape screen ,0
2246,1798_3, What Would Improve Usability ,0
2247,1798_4, Swipe gesture to control vertical scrolling when vertical scrollbar is auto visible latter is currently ignored ,0
2248,1798_5, If using tap hold allow vertical scrolling without locking into text as described above ,1
2249,1798_6, Alternatively To provide an experience consistent with the platforms SMS text input capability provide support to allow TextBox to grow as new lines are added ,0
2250,1798_7, be placed in a ScrollViewer and have the viewport follow newlines as they are added ,0
2251,1798_8, Thanks for considering ,0
2252,1799_1, Link to related App Hub suggestion url Link to related Connect Issue url I thought I had raised this as a platform request but seems it is showing up in Feature Feedback instead ,0
2253,1799_2, If you entered more ,0
2254,1799_3, when playing a video from an HTML video tag the player should allow the user to drag the progress bar to seek ahead in the video ,1
2255,1799_4, I would like to write Business Applications that get started when the phone is turned on and have as much control as a running app An idea would be having the phone snap pictures periodically and then uploading them ,1
2256,1799_5, There is currently no way to know if an EmailComposeTask was cancelled or got an error while sending ,0
2257,1800_1, I need to be able to tell if the user actually went through with the email to know whether to delete the email text ,1
2258,1800_2, Otherwise I have to ask the user if they sent it poor user experience ,0
2259,1800_3, For those of us wanting to provide free applications it would be nice if the WP supported self signed certs or the very least a widely known free SSL authority ,1
2260,1800_4, Add ServicePointManager ,1
2261,1800_5, Or at the very least add a free service to your accepted list of SSL authorities ,1
2262,1800_6, Like cacert org for instance ,0
2263,1800_7, I would like to see an agent like the scheduled task one that can be executed on a specific date and time ,1
2264,1800_8, It should be able to recur but to save battery it could be limited to daily ,0
2265,1800_9, Think of an app that needs to update the tile once a year or month to remind the user of something ,0
2266,1800_10, Currently this is not possible because the agents are disabled after days if the application is not opened ,0
2267,1801_1, App specific launchers instead of opening a site is web page check whether a compatible app is installed or registered ,0
2268,1802_1, UX is much better and ,0
2269,1803_1, To support things like midroll video advertisments multiple MediaElements are needed ,0
2270,1804_1, This is supported in Silverlight for the web ,0
2271,1805_1, it would be helpfull to have a passwordBox like control which supports Number only keyboard ,0
2272,1805_2, Numeric only passwords makes more sense for Smartphone world as it is fast convenient and easy to type ,0
2273,1805_3, private corporate WiFi authentication with a certificate is not supported at Mango ,0
2274,1806_1, This could allow for quite a few scenarios someone is currently locked in with a carrier that does not have WP phones available ,0
2275,1806_2, They could actually purchase apps on the Marketplace and use them ,0
2276,1806_3, Enable a code once and runs on Windows or Phone ,0
2277,1808_1, It would be good to have a Video Chooser Task that works in the same way as the PhotoChooserTask ,1
2278,1809_1, The reason for this is for users to be able to do things like apply filters add audio tracks crop out a relevant section etc of a recorded video and saving it back to the MediaLibrary ,0
2279,1809_2, I assume saving to the MediaLibrary will be part of the AR functionality in mango anyway ,0
2280,1809_3, This will benefit for applications which create audio or recording voice it will be easy and unified way to export audio files instead of create extra server program ,0
2281,1809_4, Cursor arrow keys are needed on the virtual keyboard ,1
2282,1809_5, Using touch to position the cursor is a good start but it is clumsy and easily off by one character which would be acceptable if there were at least a left arrow key in addition to backspace ,0
2283,1809_6, Perhaps at least press hold on backspace to bring up an arrows menu ,0
2284,1809_7, Besides myself is there any interest in adding this capability ,0
2285,1809_8, I request that the MultiScaleImage library to be able to access isolated storage ,0
2286,1809_9, There are many places where apps will not connect to a cell tower example ,0
2287,1809_10, in a general aviation or commercial aircraft where cell phones do not work well it is illegal to use in any case and also in isolated rural areas ,0
2288,1809_11, Also why pay data charges to view the same image over and over aren t music photo libraries stored on phones ,0
2289,1809_12, And finally memory is very cheap ,0
2290,1809_13, Some suggest that large images even broken into tiles are inappropriate for storage on a phone that is ridiculous ,0
2291,1809_14, If a user wants an application to host content whether it be GB of music or GB of image tiles for a needed application that should be their prerogative ,0
2292,1809_15, Local MultiScaleImage functionality is available on iPhone so please do not put WP developers at a disadvantage ,1
2293,1809_16, If a user wants to pan around a large image what difference does it make to the form factor whether it is local or online none ,0
2294,1809_17, Please get this component opened up for isolated storage use in the near future ,1
2295,1809_18, Some suggest that large images even broken into tiles are inappropriate for storage on a phone that more ,0
2296,1809_19, The implementation of the SQL Compact was a pretty steap learning curve for me as i was used to the net GUI Implementation that made it very easy to use ,0
2297,1809_20, I think there needs to be more focus on making it easier and quicker to implement these plumbing features as a lot of developers will be hobbyist and do not contain the time and knowledge required to implement of lot of these plumbing features ,1
2298,1809_21, Please make it quick and simple for us to get our ideas out there ,1
2299,1809_22, Detailed customization should be an after thought for us ,1
2300,1809_23, Allow apps with the interop capabilty flag in the manifest perhaps via custom certificate like Microsoft Office Digital Certificate for VBA Projects ,1
2301,1810_1, These are valid only on the device on which they were created so the only phone you would brick would be your dev unlocked own ,0
2302,1810_2, OK I realize that this is dependent on the carrier but WP needs to support it if the carrier can offer it ,1
2303,1810_3, Somebody correct me if I am way off base ,0
2304,1814_1, Please let me know how to do this ,0
2305,1815_1, Both on my iOS and Droid I can use my work email exchange server ,0
2306,1815_2, However the webbased certificate is not signed by a trusted member and was always allowed to okay it with those OSes ,0
2307,1815_3, WP will only let me use exchange with registered and installed certificates and will not let me bypass if I know it is okay ,0
2308,1815_4, Ability to display street side and birds eye view from bing map control ,0
2309,1815_5, When you update an app and update the App tile icon and or Background image save the update as it is not working ,0
2310,1815_6, Allow one application to launch another application with a URL ,1
2311,1815_7, The launching application should be allowed to send information to the launched application via query strings ,1
2312,1815_8, Imagine if you are calling someone who is already involved in a call the waiting notification displayed which has been available for long time in several mobiles could give you a relief to contact him later instead of doing a recurring calling and bothering him her ,0
2313,1815_9, This is a missing feature since windows mobile ,0
2314,1815_10, Do you agree that it is time to have it now ,0
2315,1815_11, Add a tile view like in old Windows Store ,1
2316,1815_12, It was great to see at a glance rating money generated by the application ,0
2317,1815_13, Enable recording of FM radio ,1
2318,1815_14, Currently in Mango these is a soft search button in the GUI displayed for context sensitive search ,0
2319,1815_15, The hardware button seems to always pull up a Bing ,0
2320,1816_1, Surely the design ideology was that the hardware search button was context sensitive ,0
2321,1817_1, If so then the soft search button is not needed and can be removed from being displayed if a hardware button is available ,1
2322,1817_2, This would free up more screen real estate especially as many application bars only have a soft search button on them anyway ,0
2323,1817_3, In order to display more details on network connection and to distinguish WiFi networks connected to ,0
2324,1817_4, Allow filtering of marketplace results within categories beyond pay free top new by adding filter by rating ex by price ex money by number of downloads ex or allow blacklisting of developers or developer rankings so spam apps and spam devs could be avoided ,1
2325,1818_1, Enable FM scan function in the developer API ,1

2327,1819_2, Allow apps to be hidden visible in the store without having to go through the whole update process ,1
2328,1820_1, Back to how it was on the old dashboard would be ideal just a simple link to toggle between visible and hidden ,0
2329,1821_1, Handy for if you have to take the back end server offline so new users can not download your app and instantly think the app is useless ,0
2330,1822_1, In the new store is not possible to delete an existing app from the store or if exist it is really well hidden ,0

2336,1824_4, A better manipulation of exif APIs will be very helpfull ,1
2337,1824_5, Read the given link for more details url ,0
2338,1824_6, When you use the DefaultItem property of the Panorama control it is as if you are just rearranging the items ,0
2339,1824_7, I use this property to restore application state after tombstoning but the user experience is terrible because this just causes the pano items to reorder themselves ,0
2340,1824_8, The correct behavior would be if the panorama were to immediately scroll to the default page whether animated or not ,0
2341,1824_9, The old developer dashboard allowed me to remove apps that I no longer want to be published ,0
2342,1824_10, I can not do this in the new developer center for apps that have passed certification and are published in the store ,0
2343,1824_11, The keywords people use in unsuccessful marketplace searches particularly in the desktop Zune application would if ranked by frequency provide useful information to developers on where to focus their development efforts ,0
2344,1824_12, This would create more opportunities for developers while also helping to provide customers with the apps they want ,0
2345,1824_13, Needed to create pro level sequencers synths and music creation related apps ,0
2346,1824_14, If I want to update a Live Tile from my own App I can not draw it is background image on the phone because if I store it to IsolatedStorage i am not able to get an URI for it which I could provide the StandardTileData Object with ,0

2349,1824_17, Some WP phone not the AT T Samsung Focus have a never screen timeout ,0
2350,1824_18, However this is for battery and powered scenarios and you do not want to be manually switching it back and forth all the time ,0
2351,1824_19, Some of us are stuck with a phone that locks itself all the time ,0
2352,1825_1, The screen lock also interrupts or prevents app deployment ,0
2353,1826_1, This makes Visual Studio fail to start the debugging session ,0

2360,1830_1, Currently you can assign to ApplicationBarIconButton an icon present on your project as ' content ' ,0
2361,1831_1, This basically means you have to determine your icons at design time ,0
2362,1831_2, By providing the ability to assign an icon placed on the IsolatedStorage the developer will be free to create button icons at runtime dynamically download them from other places etc ,0
2363,1831_3, There is no such option to delete the beta app from dashboard ,0
2364,1832_1, Even there should be a option to delete the MPNS certificate ,1

2376,1840_1, Still only partners can have a Xbox live mark on their game icon but having a one place for achievements leader boards and friends would be great WP Live ,0
2377,1840_2, Some people have had other developers submit apps to the marketplace on their behalf for many reason ,0
2378,1841_1, They may have been in a country that is not supported for example ,0
2379,1841_2, More then one developer may have worked on the app and are now splitting ,0
2380,1841_3, Some people may sell their apps to others ,0
2381,1841_4, In all these cases it breaks the update cycle for existing users because the new owner would have to create a new app instead of updating the existing one ,0
2382,1841_5, When I create a paid app with a trial option many users blow right by it because it does not show up in the free category even though a light version of the app is free via the trial ,0
2383,1841_6, Some people are resorting to the super inefficient Apple app store method of releasing versions of the app one that shows up in the free category and another that runs as a paid app ,0

2403,1843_3, Why can we not just have a store manifest that includes all localized descriptions screenshots etc ,1
2404,1843_4, which will be detected when we upload the app via the dashboard ,0
2405,1843_5, It would allow us to skip all that crazy input in different languages just to for example swap out one screenshot ,0
2406,1844_1, Alternatively provide an API for the submission process so we can at least somewhat alleviate the pain ourselves ,1
2407,1844_2, It would be a great way to better integrate applications if there was a sports news hub ,0
2408,1845_1, I imagine the default setup could simply default to news and sports from MSN or one of MS ' other affiliates then allow RSS feeds to be added ,1
2409,1845_2, Enhance that further by allowing rd party application tie ins like ESPN is app or news from a BBC or CNN application ,1

2466,1861_5, Just like the picture extras it would be great if apps like twitter and facebook could register to be on the list of applications that a user can share a piece of text with in addition to email and sms ,1

2537,0_35, Windows phone store should show total number of app downloads All Markets as well as ratings and reviews of All Markets instead of showing rates and reviews based on region because it does not give a broad view and if by chance in any country there are no reviews on your app and someone want to download your app he might not just because he can not find it first of all Cuz no rating second he she will think app does not have any reviews so it is not so good ,1

2540,0_38, At the moment it is impractical for me as a developer to keep asking my boss for his Microsoft account just to create app packages ,0
2541,0_39, If I search something the first app in the list should be the one with the best user rating and most frequent updates even if the app is not the official one ,1

2543,0_41, url If I search something the first app in the list should be the one with the best user rating and most frequent updates even if the app is not the official one ,1
2544,0_42, For example If I search Instagram the result should be User is favourite app Recomended app tag Official app Instragram BETA and then al the others ,1
2545,0_43, A lot of official apps are almost completely abandoned like Istragram Beta but some unofficial clients are really amazing ,0
2546,0_44, The main problem is that the new users do not know about third party clients apps so in my opinion this could improve a lot the user more ,0
2547,0_45, XmlnsDefinitionAttribute is an absolutely great attribute for Control Library developers ,0
2548,0_46, If you use a rd party control library or you are a control library vendor you should vote for this ,1
2549,0_47, It ' ll save you a lot of typing looking for controls and types etc ,0
2550,0_48, XmlnsDefinitionAttribute is an absolutely great attribute for Control Library developers ,0
2551,0_49, It allows the developers of that control library to greatly simplify the xaml by reducing the number of XMLNS declarations they need ,0
2552,0_50, The only way around this is for the control vendor to throw every single class that might be used in XAML not just controls but other types too in the same namespace creating a very ugly unwieldy API to code against ,1
2553,0_52, It ' ll save you a lot of typing looking more ,0

2558,0_57, The SVG data may be inline or loaded from a source local file or remote from the web There are few current tools for converting SVG to WPF Silverlight based XAML but they fall short when dealing with more complex SVG data This should work just like any other kind of image data ,1
2559,0_58, Some SVG files may be dynamically generated by a remote server SVG data loaded in a XAML view may have internal named elements ,0
2560,0_59, I would imagine that there d be a way to access the internal elements from code to manipulate them and attach event handlers hover touch etc change properties color opacity etc ,0
2561,0_60, We used this extensively in one javascript project but would have preferred to do this in XAML There s a lot of free source SVG files that usable under creative commons on Wikipedia for things like US maps electoral districts and many other rich features ,0
2562,0_61, o It s a huge time saver to piggyback on those assets ,0
2563,0_62, For example suppose you wanted to color a US map by probability of each electoral district voting a certain way ,0
2564,0_63, This is easily done with some reference data SVG from Wikipedia ,0
2565,0_64, Problem is there s no way to easily manipulate this within a XAML app I would hope that an SVG renderer element would use similar hardware acceleration that the HTML renderers use I would not expect to use javascript css classes to manipulate SVG from a XAML app but bonus points if XAML styles could be plugged in Manual conversion to XAML is an extra step in the workflow and leads to duplication of assets ,1
2566,0_65, A designer may keep tweaking the source image and must keep generating that XAML ,0
2567,0_66, That xaml would then need to be copied into a resource dictionary and can t be a separate file resource can it ,0
2568,0_67, The high level ask is to support using SVG within a XAML tree ,0
2569,0_68, The SVG data may be inline or loaded from a source local file or remote from the web There are few current tools for converting SVG to WPF Silverlight based XAML but they fall short when dealing with more complex SVG data ,0

2571,0_70, This should work just like any other kind of image data ,0
2572,0_71, Remote xaml isn t likely allowed and even if it were there d be resistance to providing vector art in two formats when SVG more ,0
2573,0_72, There appears to be no way to deploy an app to a Windows Emulator outside of manually doing so in Visual Studio ,0
2574,0_73, Without that we have no means to wrap our own tooling to launch and install built apps to the emulator ,0
2575,0_74, The older tooling AppDeployCmd exe would allow us to list the available emulators we could deploy to and deploy to them though it is support for devices left a lot to be desired ,0
2576,0_75, Oddly with Windows tooling installed and Windows SDK we can actually see the list of Windows emulators listed in the AppDeployCmd output and need to do some post filtering to separate the and emulators ,0
2577,0_76, So currently we can use the tooling to get the list of emulators but if we try to deploy to them they will start up but app deployment will fail ,0
2578,0_77, In doing some testing it appears WinAppDeployCmd may work to install an appx on a running emulator if we happen to know the ,0
2579,0_78, x x IP address of the emulator but I can find no way to get that programmatically either ,0
2580,0_79, I tried PowerShell scripts using WMI such as url See url There appears to be no way to deploy an app to a Windows Emulator outside of manually doing so in Visual Studio ,0
2581,0_80, We also have no entries listed for Windows emulators running or not in the wouldevices ' output ,0
2582,0_81, The biggest issue ask is to deploy an app to an emulator via that command line tool in much the same way the AppDeployCmd worked for ,0
2583,0_83, The older tooling AppDeployCmd exe would allow us to list the available emulators we could more ,0
2584,0_84, In my view the two main use cases for the Store search can be summarised as follows As a Windows app consumer I want to be able to search for apps by name so that I can find and download the specific app I am looking for ,0
2585,0_86, As a Windows app consumer I want to be able to search for apps by functionality so that I can find and download an app that will help me perform the task I want to carry out ,1
2586,0_87, An example of the first might be I ve heard that Wordament is good so I ll type Wordament into the search box so I can download and play it during my commute to work ,0
2587,0_88, An example of the second might be I really enjoy doing crossword puzzles so I ll type Crosswords into the search box so that I can find and download a crossword app that I play during my commute to work ,0
2588,0_89, The Store search heavily favours matching the search term to the app name over matching to the keywords ,0
2589,0_90, It would seem that the search algorithm has been developed to optimise results for use case one above at the expense of use case two ,0
2590,0_91, In my view and I can see from the forums and user voice channel that I am not alone in this the Store search provides a poor customer experience by not catering effectively for use case two ,0
2591,0_92, It is my belief that the search algorithm could be improved to cater for use case two without adversely effecting use case one ,1
2592,0_93, Intuitively if a user already knows the name of an app then it is likely that it is already fairly popular and so would be ranked highly in search results without the algorithm favouring the app name ,0
2593,0_94, In addition app names are quite specific and so searches for ' Facebook ' and ' Wordament ishould return a narrow set of results compared to searches for generic terms such as ' crosswords ' ,0
2594,0_95, Conversely new apps that are not yet popular would be unknown to consumers and so would only be found when a user browses categories in the Store or searches for apps by functionality as in use case two ,0
2595,0_96, More info url In my view the two main use cases for the Store search can be summarised as follows ,0
2596,0_97, As a Windows app consumer I want to be able to search for apps by name so that I can find and download the specific app I am looking for ,1
2597,0_100, An example of the first might be I ve heard that Wordament is good so more ,0

2601,0_104, The TextBox control is the most used control in a Windows program ,0
2602,0_105, It also cause a lot of problem either from QA or the user because of invalid data that was entered ,0
2603,0_106, Using a masked control will save a lot of time for the developer and reduce the complaints and bugs ,0
2604,0_107, Now with Win Dashboard the stack trace only provide a snippet of the error which is included in the error lines ,0

2607,0_110, From url Modern is a Standard C language projection for the Windows Runtime ,0
2608,0_111, Practically nothing is off limits to the developer hungry for power but you don t need to sacrifice productivity or safety along the way ,0
2609,0_112, About the only thing that Modern prohibits is explicit reference counting ,0
2610,0_113, It uses C s move semantics to handle reference counting reliably and sparingly ,0
2611,0_114, From url Modern is a Standard C language projection for the Windows Runtime ,0
2612,0_115, The Modern compiler produces a header only library designed to provide Standard C developers with first class access to the Windows API ,0
2613,0_116, It takes advantage of C and beyond to provide a truly modern language projection for the Windows Runtime ,0
2614,0_117, So while it is still COM under the hood a C developer should think in terms of references rather than pointers ,1
2615,0_119, About the only thing that more ,0
2616,0_120, Would be really helpful to have FindAncestor API added just like in Silverlight and WPF ,1
2617,0_121, Fix the bug App can not be searched in the Windows Store ,1
2618,0_123, Your app is published and can be found here ,0
2619,0_126, Right now we can not show progress on the taskbar for example to let a user see the current status of a download or something else ,0

2622,0_129, Currently there is no way to schedule recurring notifications using ScheduledToastNotification ,0
2623,0_130, While http proxy function lost since windows phone Now in UWP we can only set http proxy ip port username psw in the connected Wifi manually ,0
2624,0_131, TypeConverter is helpful because it allows the author of a type to provide intrinsic support for determining to from which types a type may be converted and actually converting between types most typically for converting to from string but other types as well ,0
2625,0_132, Microsoft Support recommended me to post the issue here There seems to be a long standing serious issue with the Store or possibly the dev portal which needs to be addressed urgently ,1
2626,0_133, These users are now required to buy the app again to own the app ,0
2627,0_134, Speculation It appears to me that the Store is seeing the update as a new app and therefore the original certificate is no longer recognized thereby triggering the symptoms above ,0
2628,0_135, Please implement a permanent fix to the relevant back end systems ,1
2629,0_136, Also we need a supplementary fix to the issues faced by existing affected users without resorting them to contacting Microsoft customer support to restore their purchase by way of adding credit to re purchase the app ,1
2630,0_137, The issue gets complicated when the users owned the app via a free promo and Support may not be willing to restore the purchase using this method ,0
2631,0_138, Feel free to contact me if further info is required ,0
2632,0_139, Thank you ,0
2633,0_140, Microsoft Support recommended me to post the issue here ,0

2635,0_142, There is a history of apps affected by this issue and possibly more apps to be affected in the future if the issue goes unfixed ,0
2636,0_143, The problem starts after a certain app update ,0

2641,0_148, Please create this option native to TextBox control It is very usefull in WinForm projects and could speed up development on universal app too ,1
2642,0_149, There are a lot of feedbacks asking to allow developers to delete remove apps and IAPs from their Dev Center ,0
2643,0_150, So I think you should add some hide some option to not only unpublish app but eventually logically remove their entries from the dashboard main app list graphs etc You can eventually add a page where all the apps IAPs hidden are listed and there the developer can eventually bring back them to the dashboard in case he changes his mind ,1
2644,0_151, Do you think it can work this way ,0
2645,0_152, There are a lot of feedbacks asking to allow developers to delete remove apps and IAPs from their Dev Center ,1
2646,0_153, These feedbacks were all refused and I can imagine the motivation behind this so I try to formulate better what is really the point is on this If a developer has many unpublished apps or IAPs their dashboard start to become a mess and the developer have to see to a lot of not more relevant data regarding to app that there are not no longer maintained or simply products which the developer is not focused right now ,0
2647,0_154, So I think you should more ,0
2648,0_155, It is frustrated for a devoloper then an app is ' nt Show in any category and the app can only find per direct search by Name ,0
2649,0_156, Inexplicably the UWP does not include the WPF WrapPanel that was introduced nearly years ago ,0
2650,0_157, And with the VariableSizedWrapGrid you must hardwire the column span and row span of each item to ensure everything fits ,0
2651,0_158, One simple example where the WrapPanel is essential is when displaying a tag cloud ,0
2652,0_159, The WrapGrid makes it possible to display a fully adaptable UI since as the container gets narrower on small screens everything can still be seen ,0
2653,0_160, But it is not just for tag clouds ,0
2654,0_161, The WrapPanel behavior is how items flow in HTML ,0
2655,0_162, It is astounding to me that such a useful UI control one that Microsoft built years ago and with behavior that powers nearly every HTML page in existence was left out of the UWP ,0
2656,0_163, Inexplicably the UWP does not include the WPF WrapPanel that was introduced nearly years ago ,0
2657,0_164, This panel is similar to a StackPanel but if there are too many items to fit in a row the subsequent items are displayed in the next row down ,0
2658,0_165, There are other panels in the UWP that do something similar like the WrapGrid but this doesn t work well if the items are variable size ,0

2668,0_176, Windows Runtime should allow public non sealed classes This is already implemented for XAML classes now this should be available for all Windows Runtime components ,1

3254,0_839, I think the new dev center is a great step What I would like to see is a button on the language description pages that are supported for an app That would take your default language description and fields and then use Microsoft is Translator to translate all the fields to the language I spend a few hours at least each time I update the app using online translators and copying and pasting between all of the fields and a online translator I understand that having a translation is important but I am not a linguist I honestly think I learned programming before proper grammar I am a individual person making apps on my own and spending almost a whole day just to post the app descriptions is a big pain ,1
3255,0_840, maybe have a button next to each field where it would take the text from the primary description page ,0
3256,0_841, and put it onto the description field for Japanese for example For my app I have it in about language Country descriptions which is a big task to handle ,0

3285,0_873, As you know online games and app connectivity are quite popular features these days I may be overlooking it but it would beneficial to both devs and Microsoft if Windows Universal apps had access to a universal server for networking apps together ,1
3286,0_874, This way low bandwidth overhead apps could implement multiplayer online interactivity ,0
3287,0_875, This might require some processing on the part of Microsoft in the form of custom server processing of incoming and outgoing data but Microsoft could add an additional charge for apps that take advantage of this feature to cover cloud computing storage costs ,1
3288,0_876, In short if low bandwidth MMOs could be made which scaled in revenue and bandwidth according to how many of the apps are purchased in use ,0
3289,0_877, Microsoft could recoup it is costs by an extra overhead on sales of such applications ,1
3290,0_878, More apps sold more cloud processing and cloud data storage more revenue ,0
3291,0_879, Less apps low cloud processing and data storage and less revenue ,0
3292,0_880, The point is having some sort of universal capacity to network apps together safely through a universal Microsoft service to greater or lesser extents which would then be proportionally reflected in pricing relative to the amount of usage the apps need would open up developer capacity and increase variety on the store ,1

3321,0_912, SMIL is the THE standard format for animations used both for the Web as part of SVG url url and as the official OpenDocument format for animations and graphic effects url Currently you cannot include SMIL and SVG animated images in XAML and in IE you need to use a polyfill based on the web animation standard to run SMIL animations ,0
3322,0_913, Eric Willigers from Google has created the official SMIL polyfill implemented entirely on the Web Animations API ,0
3323,0_914, You can find it here url But the web animation standard is NOT a declarative language for animations you still need SMIL to describe animations in browsers ,0

3345,0_938, Add the ability to send the application for inclusion in the collection of applications store For example I want to include my WinGeoChat application in the collection Apps for Work ,1
3346,0_939, It would be awesome if for every app on the store instead of doing the traditional feedback system we could do a collaborative system along the lines of uservoice That way users with similar thoughts would be grouped together the developer would get a better idea of what people want and users can see when developers have considered their feedback ,1
3347,0_940, Windows has a great feedback system ,0
3348,0_941, Microsoft should provide a SDK for developers to intergate such feedback system in their Apps ,0

3357,0_950, With UWP an AppointmentStore retrieved via RequestStoreAsync AppointmentStoreAccessType AppCalendarsReadWrite will still return non app calendars from GetAppointmentCalendarAsync This is different from the Windows Phone behavior and inconsistent with FindAppointmentCalendarsAsync which will not return those calendars This can give an app the false impression of being able to modify a non app calendar until a Save is attempted and fails with unauthorized exception ,0

3362,0_955, does nothing other than cause confusion and frustration and in the case of some people although hopefully not many and definitely not me a reason to leave ,0
3363,0_956, NET ,0
3364,0_957, If all variations could be merged I think most developers would be able to adjust to it and there would be less confusion in the future ,0

3367,0_963, If all variations could more ,0
3368,0_964, Developers should not get bad ratings and reviews when something is broken in a Preview build just because you release unfinished builds to users who have no idea what Preview means other than getting the new cool stuff first ,1
3369,0_965, Not everybody wants a toy and moving tiles around by touch Some want a tool that satisfies their need not create problems ,0
3370,0_966, Photos email internet games and stability in their learning curve ,0
3371,0_967, It takes years to learn how to handle windows ,0

3380,0_981, At this moment the Launcher when launchs an URI it only supports http uris it will be interesting that supports file 😕 uris to send the launcher to open PDFs words and any file with just the URI we do not need the StorageFile And in a BackgroundTask the Launcher just does not launch websites it is interesting to launch websites and reports in the computer in the morning saving time ,0
3381,0_982, This also applies to icons At present to pin an application to the desktop in all versions of Windows one must find the executable file right click on it choose to create a shortcut be told Windows can not create a shortcut here and select Yes ,0
3382,0_983, My suggestion is to add an option to pin the application in use for future use when an application is open ,1
3383,0_984, One way to do this is to provide an option to create a shortcut to the desktop when an application is open ,0
3384,0_985, One way to do this would be to add such an option when a user right clicks on the application icon on the top left of the window ,0
3385,0_986, At present the user gets options to move size maximise or close ,0
3386,0_987, These options are available across the top bar of the window I suggest adding an option to Create a Shortcut ,1
3387,0_988, In it is simplest form the new Shortcut would open the application ,0
3388,0_989, There might be a flyout with further options to create a Shortcut to the Application or the Current File or Create a Tile ,0
3389,0_990, The benefit of this idea would be that I often find that having opened an application I would like to have it easily available to use again ,0
3390,0_991, At present I have to search for the executable etc ,0
3391,0_992, I hope this idea is useful and perhaps others could comment on whether it is practical easily implemented or not and any enhancements ,0
3392,0_993, I apologise if there are better or more appropriate places to post this idea ,0

3396,0_999, Would be nice to make split view behave the way Surface home screen behaves OOB ,1
3397,0_1000, We end up writing lot of custom Styles in XAML for Split view ,0
3398,0_1001, Further SPlitview should have option to display only the button in compact mode ,1
3399,0_1002, There are few standard patterns for navigation and if Split view has those OOB then developing apps because a breeze ,0
3400,0_1003, Developers should be focusing more on App as opposed to implement the standard navigation pattern and spend effort on styling ,1

3405,0_1307, Google reader API allows to create feeds like ie url ,0
3406,0_1308, I can import this feed in Wordpress or Joomla so when I find an interesting article in Google Reader I simply star it with automatic pubblication in my blog ,0
3407,0_1309, It would be very nice to have this in Feedly ,1
3408,0_1310, I know it works in IE now not sure about but definately not ,0
3409,0_1311, I am forced to use IE on Windows emtong at work with no ability to install anything or use portable Firefox etc ,0

3411,0_1313, want to still be able to subscribe to Twitter feeds without having to create Twitter account ,1
3412,0_1314, Please make an option to login that does not include Google ,1
3413,0_1315, There are a lot of us who want anonomosity in what we are reading ,1
3414,0_1316, We want it to be between Feedly and us only especially now that the government is working to get open access to our Google accounts ,1
3415,0_1317, Is this a recent change or something I have just seen ,0
3416,0_1318, I could not find any option in Feedly Extension to turn this off So I have turned background apps off in Chrome but would rather this be an option in Feedly ,1
3417,0_1319, I like that Instapaper is an option but it is very clunky ,0
3418,0_1320, Clicking the Instapaper button in feedly opens a new browser window on the Instapaper site and then I have to wait for it to load my account and then I have to click another button to save the article ,0
3419,0_1321, Would be so much nicer if I just clicked the Instapaper button in feedly and that was that ,1
3420,0_1322, It would be cool if there were some way to receive notifications of new posts in the Mac OS X and iOS notification center ,1

3425,0_1327, Haven installed the Feedly extension I did notice that I has some weird tab that decided to add itself ,0
3426,0_1328, Not liking that I thought diabling the extension will solve this ,0
3427,0_1329, No much problem surfing later I discover that I have to unpin the tab ,0
3428,0_1330, Also the tab does not stay unpinned ,0
3429,0_1331, THIS IS BAD ,0
3430,0_1332, I did not put the tab there and I DON ' T WANT IT ,0
3431,0_1333, GET IT OFF ,0
3432,0_1334, You absolutely cannot do this ,0
3433,0_1335, I do not care how many votes this suggestions gets if I see it happen again feedly will be DEAD to me ,0

3436,0_1338, I generate a majority of my Google Reader RSS content from manually set up Google Alerts by setting up Google keyword searches and selecting Deliver to Google Reader ,0
3437,0_1339, Can you create a connection between Google Alerts and Feedly so that when I update a feed in Google Alerts the change will be picked up by Feedly ,1

3439,0_1341, Create Kippt integration to allow sharing to Kippt com ,1
3440,0_1342, Being able to follow reddit topics from within feedly ,0
3441,0_1343, Currently cloud feedly com works only with IE browser which is still rather new to the world especially corporate one ,0
3442,0_1344, IE is too old and probably too many hacks to support it ,0
3443,0_1345, But IE would be nice to support ,1
3444,0_1346, Is there any way i can save to Pocket directly without opening a separate web page each time ,0
3445,0_1347, Google Reader sends new articles every day as a periodical format do Kindle Mail address being able to send every subscriptions os just located in a folder ,0
3446,0_1348, Better than that would be an option to catch the article text and send it completely not just the resume from rss as some sites do somewhat like the instapaper does ,1
3447,0_1349, Create a separate registration login system independent of a Google account ,1
3448,0_1350, Right now if I have two Google accounts and separate Chrome sessions one for work and one for personal use I cant use feedly across sessions ,0
3449,0_1351, Another win is that right now I have to generate my multi factor authentication code when I try to login to Feedly on my iPad which is not always convenient for Feed reading purposes ,0
3450,0_1352, Feedly looks nice but NewsRob provides a significantly more useful experience for users with lots of feeds url ,0
3451,0_1353, Allow a new version of NewsRob to use the feedly backend API ,1
3452,0_1354, Promote Feedly by having that version of NewsRob being re branded with Feedly logo ,1
3453,0_1355, A desktop version that would integrate both online services Facebook Twitter Pinterest with desktop services photoshop outlook messages ,0
3454,0_1356, I prefer using the reeder on my desktop than Feedly on the browser since it opens links on the app helping me focus on my reading ,0
3455,0_1357, The IFTTT ingredient ArticleContent does not contain the full article body it saves the st paragraph or nothing at all ,0
3456,0_1358, We loose the main goal of the use of IFTTT ,0
3457,0_1359, Can you enable full article content from the original rss feed ,0
3458,0_1360, Integration with Net News Wire so we can keep updated on every Mac I use NNW for publishing to my blog with MarsEdit ,0
3459,0_1361, It would be great if feedly would provide the current count of unread articles to TeslaUnread which would show that number in the corner of the app icon on Nova Launcher ,1
3460,0_1362, Maybe you need to contact TeslaCoil Software for information on how to implement that ,1
3461,0_1363, As an alternative to that you could also create a x widget mimicking the app icon with unread counter ,1
3462,0_1364, However the downside of that would be that you could not place this widget in a homescreen folder ,0
3463,0_1365, This is very powerful feature ,0
3464,0_1366, I suggest do it like it is done in the Google Reader Watcher url ,1
3465,0_1367, Additional the Watcher provided notifications about a number of the unreaded articles ,0
3466,0_1368, Yes I know that the first build of Mac OS A u is as slow as a tortoise ,0
3467,0_1369, Burt the feedly extension seems to be horribly broken ,0
3468,0_1370, Create a webapp for Ubuntu so Feedly can be integrated into the messaging menu show notification bubbles or indicate the number of unread feeds on the launcher ,1
3469,0_1371, More info url ,0
3470,0_1372, Please enhance the new back up function url and enable OneDrive as well ,1
3471,0_1373, Right now the only way I can find to make a stand alone Feedly app with Fluid is to use these instructions url ,0
3472,0_1374, I would much rather be able to create a Fluid app by using Fluid in the normal manner ,0
3473,0_1375, I just got the new chromecast and one of my first thoughts was that it would be cool to send movies from my feeds straight to the TV ,1
3474,0_1376, I know I can watch them via mirroring on the computer but something more native would be appreciated ,1
3475,0_1377, Integrate Facebook Twitter YouTube and other social accounts into Feedly so I can read the timeline posts and other in Feedly ,1
3476,0_1378, Like your Facebook News Feed could be a feed on Feedly ,0
3477,0_1379, New videos from users you subscribed to on Youtube can be a whole feed like migrate the entire Home Page of your Youtube account and put it as a feed here ,1
3478,0_1380, And Twitter tweets from your followers can be another feed ,1
3479,0_1381, The OPML export feature should include tagging data ,1
3480,0_1382, I would like to be able to switch to another service without losing all of the tags I use to organize my source library ,1
3481,0_1383, Microsoft has a RSS Platform for a common store of RSS feeds across IE and Outlook ,0
3482,0_1384, It would be nice to sync any feeds from that store to Feedly ,1
3483,0_1385, It would eliminate the need for an add on to IE as people can use the native button to have their feeds pulled into Feedly ,1
3484,0_1386, It would be great if there was a Feedly plug in for the Mozilla Thunderbird email client ,1
3485,0_1387, Right now I can have several Google apps open in separate tabs in Thunderbird ,0
3486,0_1388, So each morning I start my day with my Inbox Google Calendar and Google Reader each in their own tab right there together in one app ,0
3487,0_1389, I love that ,0
3488,0_1390, With the fazing out of Google Reader it would be great if Feedly could take it is place in my third tab ,1
3489,0_1391, I notice that when viewing full articles tumblr feeds work just great EXCEPT for photosets ,0
3490,0_1392, They seem to get out of order and the one in the top right is out of place ,0
3491,0_1393, It is a minor thing but for someone who follows a lot of tumblr blogs it can get annoying ,0
3492,0_1394, I know you can set a preference to save an article to a read later service instead of saving it to Feedly but I like Feedly is save feature within the apps ,0
3493,0_1395, However sometimes I would prefer to send an article to InstaPaper Readability or Pocket AND STILL have it saved in Feedly ,0
3494,0_1396, Could you install something like that under the sharing options ,1
3495,0_1397, Have the app available in the for Lion OSX in the app store ,1
3496,0_1398, url reading becomes more efficient because spritzing increases the time your brain spends processing content without having to waste time searching for the next word ,0
3497,0_1399, The direct posting from the feedly to the yammer is much preferred by many of enterprise business persons ,0
3498,0_1400, Currently we can only choose safari and chrome in options ,0
3499,0_1401, It would be nice to open articles in the browser we actually use like Mercury in my case ,1
3500,0_1403, Many of us use Beyondpod as the go to app for pod casts ,0
3501,0_1404, It was easy to integrate with Google Reader ,0
3502,0_1405, Perhaps a similar situation could be made with feedly ,1
3503,0_1406, I subscribe to my YouTube subscriptions in Feedly and so much appreciate this feature ,0
3504,0_1407, I find it easier to keep up with my subscriptions in Feedly than in YouTube ,0
3505,0_1408, However most of the time I just want to get some of those videos added to my YouTube playlist Watch Later ,0
3506,0_1409, It would be awesome to have a click option to add any YouTube video in any post directly to my YouTube Watch Later playlist ,1
3507,0_1410, I am not sure what the deal is with Buffer but it seems like a needless step ,0
3508,0_1411, For some unknown reason it decided to buffer my post until time tomorrow ,0
3509,0_1412, What the heck ,0
3510,0_1413, Is there an actual reason you cannot share directly to Facebook Twitter anymore ,0
3511,0_1414, Is it not allowed ,0
3512,0_1415, Do you not have the proper agreements in place ,0
3513,0_1416, Can you get them ,0
3514,0_1417, That would be wonderful ,0
3515,0_1418, I am not the first person to post this ,0
3516,0_1419, Look it up ,0
3517,0_1420, I dislike the fact that you have started to mask users Bitly URLs with your own feedly links ,0
3518,0_1421, I realize that your link still pings my link and get the analytics but i have a custom URL for a reason ,0
3519,0_1422, I understand why you might do this for the FREE version of Feedly but i implore you to not mask users custom URLs in your upcoming Paid Pro version ,1
3520,0_1423, Would love a click Add To InstaPaper rather than opening a new window yes i have a password and even the browser javascript bug ,1
3521,0_1424, Thank you ,0
3522,0_1425, Add FeedReader to the App Center list ,1
3523,0_1426, Right now it is connected to the wrong account i have more than one buffer accounts ,0
3524,0_1427, There is no option to disconnect in any way ,0
3525,0_1428, I already tried to reinstall the app ,0
3526,0_1429, share directly with Twitter instead of Buffer ,0
3527,0_1430, I am using this app for my iPad and yours for the iPhone and Laptop ,0
3528,0_1431, It would be great if you could share the API with the developer allowing a seamless sync amongst the apps as it happens now with Google Reader ,1
3529,0_1432, url ,0
3530,0_1433, Deploy the latest version of Feedly so that I can update the app on my Kindle Fire ,1
3531,0_1434, It seemed like for a few days Feedly was using Chrome Custom tabs instead of opening links in the external Chrome app ,0
3532,0_1435, It was a little jarring at first but once I realized what was going on I really liked it So why did you quickly remove that feature ,0
3533,0_1436, So why did you quickly remove that feature ,0
3534,0_1437, I understand that a lot of people who choose to have links open in Chrome may not like it but I really liked having links be added to my Chrome history while still feeling like I was in the Feedly app ,0
3535,0_1438, Will you be making that an additional option along side open directly in browser ,0
3536,0_1439, url ,0
3537,0_1440, Allow for default settings so that when this new defaulting mode is enabled clicking the Evernote icon will save with no additional interaction ,1
3538,0_1441, Default tags would also be helpful even better configurable content keyword tagging would be great ,1
3539,0_1442, Have an option to make items open directly in the Chrome Browser on mobile ,1
3540,0_1443, Please make a feedly widget gadget for iGoogle or equivalent ,1
3541,0_1444, A Chrome Firefox extension that shows a counter of unread items with a dropdown that lets the user see the items ,0
3542,0_1445, Similar to the Official Reader Notifier from Google ,0
3543,0_1446, There can be apps installed in system that catch http url and display it is content inside itselves ,0
3544,0_1447, Built in browser of Feedly brakes such behavior ,0
3545,0_1448, Pushbullet is an amazing sharing app ,0
3546,0_1449, It pushes stuff from your one device to other as well as to other person ,0
3547,0_1450, Sometimes when I am reading a feed and I want to share it directly with a person it is very easy to to push it to someone ,0
3548,0_1451, I know it already does that for Android app well because Android OS lists all the apps that keep sharing capability when I hit ' Share ' icon in the feedly app but it would be awesome to have it in the web app ,1
3549,0_1452, basically instead of having to manually install the Firefox plugin every time there is an update it should auto update ,1
3550,0_1453, Maybe you should consider including the plugin in the Firefox Addon repo marketplace ,1
3551,0_1454, Would be great to be able to read my feedly feeds on ighome com instead of having to go to feedly com ,1
3552,0_1455, So flipbook sort of did this but they did it awful and i unistalled ,0
3553,0_1456, yes i want feedly to replicate google reader but I want it to do more ,1
3554,0_1457, Can you bring in my twitter feed and know which one is I have already read ,1
3555,0_1458, ie do that google reader feedly does for RSS but with twitter or facebook or pinterest ,1
3556,0_1459, give me ONE place to consume everything but only see it once unless I save it ,1
3557,0_1460, ohhh that would be awesome ,0
3558,0_1461, Feedly client does not support Android so I was forced to use alternative Android apps ,0
3559,0_1462, I tried more than on my Nook Simple Touch ,0
3560,0_1463, And all of them have the same problem when trying to log into Feedly ,0
3561,0_1464, After entering Google username and password I get onto the Moved temporarily page ,0
3562,0_1465, After clicking on the only link on the page I get an empty page ,0
3563,0_1466, Offering other ways to log in or even Feedly is own registration system might also help ,1
3564,0_1467, Every time I restart Chrome feedly mini appears on every web page ,0
3565,0_1468, I want to turn it off ,0
3566,0_1469, I have updated my preferences which works until I close the browser and restart it then my preference is set to show it again ,0
3567,0_1470, I have tried the gReader and Press Android clients ,0
3568,0_1471, Both show we a Google login in a web view within their apps ,0
3569,0_1472, This is insecure because I cannot verify that I am not phished and that I am talking directly to Google ,0
3570,0_1473, Such a login process should not be allowed ,1
3571,0_1474, Login should go through the Google account stored on the Android device ,1
3572,0_1475, Make the Safari extension open the Feedly page in a new tab window when clicking the Feedly button similar to the Safari GReader extension ,1
3573,0_1476, I did not see anyone else suggest this but I would think it would be very simple for Flip Board to add support for your service ,1
3574,0_1477, I see no reason why they would not because I know they transferred over a bunch of Google Reader feeds but they are not doing what feedly is ,0
3575,0_1478, Would be nice to have ,0
3576,0_1479, Would love the ability to monitor specific pages that do not have rss feeds at set intervals and be able to vary the alert options such as getting an email etc when the pages change ,1
3577,0_1480, Thanks and please keep up the great work ,0
3578,0_1481, Can I only not find it or is it really gone ,0
3579,0_1482, Since today I cannot send to Instapaper anymore which was very useful for me ,0
3580,0_1483, I am using Safari ,0
3581,0_1484, percent of my blogs are music blogs and i would say percent of posts have soundcloud streams embedded into them ,0
3582,0_1485, to visit the sites externally for EVERY page is not very convient ,0
3583,0_1486, could you make this happen ,0
3584,0_1487, Google Reader never did but I suspect that is because they quit investing R D into improvements ,0
3585,0_1488, Allow us to import twitter lists and view them like regular feeds ,1
3586,0_1489, Support login with Twitter Facebook Microsoft Yahoo VK account etc and remove google account login support ,1
3587,0_1490, Allow Android app to provide an option to open within the application or open in a browser ,1
3588,0_1491, I have read that you did have tumblr integration and then it was gone ,0
3589,0_1492, Like a Send to tumblr button and liking posts from tumblr feeds ,0
3590,0_1493, I assume there was problems with it but some of us really use it and it would be great to have it back ,1
3591,0_1494, So far this is the best feed reader I have tried ,0
3592,0_1495, Please consider it ,0
3593,0_1496, Thanks ,0
3594,0_1497, On Android devices it is hard to add new feeds to Feedly ,0
3595,0_1498, You can not use paste in the search bar field and you can not use Feedly as a sharing option in other Android apps Dolphin Browser etc ,0
3596,0_1499, It is really annoying to remember every interesting site until I can use a desktop computer ,0
3597,0_1500, Please please add an option to easily add content by using a mobile device ,1
3598,0_1501, Thanks ,0
3599,0_1502, Make a Chrome packaged app for Feedly please ,1
3600,0_1503, So I can launch Feedly from google desktop app launcher ,0
3601,0_1504, I am talking about just integrating my stream followed tumblrs that is reading not posting ,0
3602,0_1505, I keep reading that feedly has tumblr integration but can not find it anywhere ,0
3603,0_1506, I just want my tumblr content to show up as articles without having to add every single one as RSS ,1
3604,0_1507, I keep reading that that is possible but can not find any setting or even anyone explaining HOW it is done ,0
3605,0_1508, If it is indeed possible maybe a short how to in the help section is in order ,1
3606,0_1509, If it is not that would also be great to have clarified somewhere FAQ maybe ,1
3607,0_1510, Youtube video work fine on feedly but somehow vimeo video is not showing the content instead showing error hashtag ,0
3608,0_1511, Take a The Verge for example ,0
3609,0_1512, Better support for Podcasts ,0
3610,0_1513, I use BeyondPod on my Android phone and it supported integration of sorts with Feedly ,0
3611,0_1514, My desire is to be able to catch up on podcasts either on my phone or on my desktop such that if I have listened to a podcast completely from either source ie from my browser at home or work or on my cell phone that the episode would be marked listened to or read and disappear from the list in Feedly on any of my machines as well as drop off of my BeyondPod list ,1
3612,0_1515, Ideally if Feedly and BeyondPod could get together and synchronize the position within a podcast would be excellent ,1
3613,0_1516, That said as a podcast player Feedly leaves a lot to be desired ,0
3614,0_1517, From what I can tell merely starting to play a podcast marks it as read or essentially completely listened to ,0
3615,0_1518, Furthermore if I am careless and click somewhere else like to read another article Feedly will stop the playback and go to the place I clicked ,0
3616,0_1519, It should warn me ,1
3617,0_1520, Finally a popout player would be nice for the audio video of podcasts ,1
3618,0_1521, Chrome extension required too much permission extension can access Your data on all websites ,0
3619,0_1522, Please reduce required permission for chrome extension ,1
3620,0_1523, work with soundgecko so anything I mark in feedly goes to soundgecko for readout ,1
3621,0_1524, Feedly should let users login through Mozilla Persona or Gravatar which do not track users ,1
3622,0_1525, Persona is made by the makers of the Firefox browser and Gravatar is made by WordPress ,0
3623,0_1526, I would like to change my log in for feedly so that it does not match my google account which contains other personal data ,0
3624,0_1527, How ,0
3625,0_1528, I cba to leave feedly but I want to know what other people are saying and I want to be able to contribute without signing up to anything ,0
3626,0_1529, If a blog does use disqus the comments should be viewable and a reply able to be added directly from feedly ,1
3627,0_1530, make App Extension Plugin for all browsers with one click to add feed from any website ,1
3628,0_1531, There are some private blogs on wordpress com ,0
3629,0_1532, You can subscribe to them in wordpress reader once you have access to them but you can not use them outside wordpress ,0
3630,0_1533, When you could connect your feedly to your wordpress com account why should not you be able to subscribe to them ,0
3631,0_1534, I do not know if wordpress has an API for this ,0
3632,0_1535, I guess such a feature would be a big advantage for your service ,1
3633,0_1536, Even though I am logged in to Google in the same browser and I have already logged in to Feedly with my google account and granted access to use what it wants it still keeps logging me out then making me go through this process every couple of days why ,0
3634,0_1537, I wish as feedly pro user if I save the feeds in Evernote I want to tag the note not only the notebook but also the tag of Evernote ,1
3635,0_1538, The utm parameter added to your links breaks them at some sites ,0
3636,0_1539, Case in point New York Magazine ,0
3637,0_1540, Creating a win win situation for readers and content creators ,0
3638,0_1542, Further thoughts feedly could develop isubscription options ' for content creators ,1
3639,0_1543, i e feedly handles payment and delivery of information creator creates information and receives revenue ,0
3640,0_1544, Readers get access to contribution only content ,0
3641,0_1545, It is been seen over time how simple barriers can stop people from doing activities that they want to do and that benefit them and others ,0
3642,0_1546, I would like to see better integration with Google services across the board specifically GMail Google and Google Drive ,1
3643,0_1547, I would like the ability to email articles with GMail post them to Google and save them to Google Drive ' cause Google does not own quite enough of my soul yet ,1
3644,0_1548, Though this idea has been expressed to varying degrees with regard to specific services like google translate I have not seen it expressed generally ,0
3645,0_1549, This option existed before ,0
3646,0_1550, Now I have to go the the source article to have the option to post to a LinkedIn group ,0
3647,0_1551, It is a relatively minor detail but it would be really convenient ,0
3648,0_1552, Import RSS from other readers ,1
3649,0_1553, Beyond Pod is my main feed reader when I am not on my computer ,0
3650,0_1554, I like it because of it is built in browser and various settings for feeds and podcasts which the Google Reader app did not have ,0
3651,0_1555, Please consider speaking to the people of Beyond Pod to integrate with their app ,1
3652,0_1556, Feedly is beautiful and I would love to use it on my Windows Phone ,0
3653,0_1557, Allow publishers to trigger feedly to refresh feedly is cached version of their RSS feeds ,1
3654,0_1558, Feedly does not seem to notice when existing feed content for a date time changes and refresh their cache ,0
3655,0_1559, Letting publishers trigger that refresh could be a work around when there are errors in the publisher is feed ,1
3656,0_1560, add integration with Trello ,1
3657,0_1561, Evernote sharing in feedly seems to cause the Chrome Evernote plugin to sign out the user and then Feedly takes you to a web page version of Evernote rather than using the Evernote plugin clipper to push it directly into the application or push it transparently to the web ,0
3658,0_1562, I just see a blank screen on IE ,0
3659,0_1563, Since i ' ts my work computer I can not control the software upgrade ,0
3660,0_1564, If you do not fix that i will seriously consider droping feedly ,0
3661,0_1565, Chromecast support would be great so I could read my news on big screen ,1
3662,0_1566, I love how you have pintrest integration on your images please consider adding GimmeBar integration as well ,1
3663,0_1567, The type of users on gimmebar vs pintrest is night and day ,0
3664,0_1568, great app ,0
3665,0_1569, gimme bar url ,0
3666,0_1570, As above ,0
3667,0_1571, I would love to be able to export all of my saved for later articles to my kindle so I can read it via e ink ,1
3668,0_1572, I used to subscribe to instapaper is premium service and it exported all of my articles into a kindle book with a table of contents etc ,0
3669,0_1573, I feel like this might be easy to integrate with a service that is already up and running like SendtoReader com OR I would gladly pay dollar dollar dollar to have the option for Feedly to do it on it is own and send to my kindle ,1
3670,0_1574, Feedly allows folder order to be rearranged instead of appearing in alphabetical order ,0
3671,0_1575, This is useful to me as I would prefer that a group or groups of feeds in some folders appear at the bottom of the all items view ,0
3672,0_1576, I changed the folder order via the Feedly web interface organize but the changes in folder order are not being reflected in Mr Reader ,0
3673,0_1577, I logged out of then back into the Feedly account in Mr Reader but the folders are still appearing in ascending alphabetical order ,0
3674,0_1578, Please enhance your API ,1
3675,0_1579, I rarely use Google Plus but there are few very interesting people using it who is post I would like to read ,0
3676,0_1580, For example Linus Torvalds ,0
3677,0_1581, On Feedly Android App when I share something through email it goes straight to Gmail app when I rather want to use the Regular Email App on that plataform ,1
3678,0_1582, Make it possible for us to choose the Mail App we want to use ,1
3679,0_1583, As a feedly users we all know the pain of having to deal with truncated feeds ,0
3680,0_1584, This problem becomes more prevalent when using mobile apps that rely on feedly like Press on Android ,0
3681,0_1585, I would like to request the capability to run articles through the readability mobilizer before they are inserted into our feeds ,1
3682,0_1586, This would help to solve the problem of truncation and poor article formatting ,0
3683,0_1587, I have missed the email subscriptions feature of the old pre bloglines ever since they discontinued it ,0
3684,0_1588, I would gladly become a Feedly Pro subscriber if you offered something comparable ,0
3685,0_1589, In a nutshell you could create a bunch of random email addresses that you could use when subscribing to newsletters etc and then any emails sent to one of those addresses would show up as a standard HTML feed ,1
3686,0_1590, This was fantastic for those sites which offer more content in their email newsletter than their RSS feed or lack an RSS feed completely ,0
3687,0_1591, A perfect use case for this would be to turn twitter facebook etc notifications on and forward those to these email addresses instead of having them clog up my inbox ,1
3688,0_1592, This could be used for any of these closed services which do not offer RSS feeds ,0
3689,0_1593, The closest solution to this I have found is to use mailinator to create the throwaway emails and they support rss feeds but they also strip out all images attachments etc and generate plain text feeds so this is not a good solution ,0
3690,0_1594, Please consider adding this type of feature to feedly ,0
3691,0_1595, In iGoogle there was the Google Reader gadget ,0
3692,0_1596, One of the very popular alternatives to iGoogle is netvibes com ,0
3693,0_1597, It would be cool if there was a feedly gadget for netvibes ,1
3694,0_1598, oEmbed is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a URL on third party sites ,0
3695,0_1599, Eagerly waiting on connection with Evernote ,0
3696,0_1600, There are my tags I use daily ,0
3697,0_1601, The way Flipboard has implemented Twitter is that it grabs the content in the tweet and displays it so rather than a user having to click a link to read an article or view an image it simply gets the article content or image and displays it with any text of the tweet acting as a caption ,0
3698,0_1602, It would be great if I could integrate my Twitter account into Feedly the same way and have full images or articles displayed alongside my RSS images and articles ,1
3699,0_1603, SoundGecko is a great way to be able to listen to articles that you want to read later while in the car or on the go ,0
3700,0_1604, I use it every day ,0
3701,0_1605, I would love to have direct integration so that I can easily send articles to SoundGecko from within the Feedly app ,1
3702,0_1606, I have only noticed this on two feeds my own blog and XKCD is ,0
3703,0_1607, In both cases what should be a float left is actually changed in the code to a float right ,0
3704,0_1608, See attached ,0
3705,0_1609, This does not occur in Google Reader where the original layout displays normally ,0
3706,0_1610, Since the attribute is not changed in Reader I concluded that the problem is with Feedly not the RSS feed itself ,0
3707,0_1611, Please enhance the new back up function url and enable local drive integration ,1
3708,0_1612, This would allow anyone to back up to DropBox GoogleDrive Synology Cloudstation Microsoft OneDrive or any other cloud solution which has a local drive representation in addition to allowing me to save it on a local machine ,0
3709,0_1613, I can login into my account for the past days ,0
3710,0_1614, I was logging in using my google credentials ,0
3711,0_1615, The Oauth screen is popping up and hanging ,0
3712,0_1616, It would be nice to be able to add usenet newsgroup in Add Content such as comp ,1
3713,0_1617, Mailing list would be great as well Great job ,0
3714,0_1618, something like AntennaPod url would be very nice ,1
3715,0_1619, Maybe you could send them an API or something so they can add the option to sync with Feedly once GReader disappears ,1
3716,0_1620, It would be super useful if you are able to choose your own default email app ,1
3717,0_1621, Not everybody uses the Gmail app as default some others use CloudMagic Mailbox Inbox K and such ,0
3718,0_1622, Please guys make it happen ,0
3719,0_1623, I cannot login to my Feedly account using Windows Microsoft Edge even after deleting all cookies etc ,0
3720,0_1624, I can still login with iexplore ,0
3721,0_1625, I cannot tell if this is a problem with Edge or with Feedly ,0
3722,0_1626, Google Reader allows you to get a public rss feed for each category label used ,0
3723,0_1627, Is very useful for sharing feeds using it with wordpress blogrolls ecc ,0
3724,0_1628, It would be great if google button opened an app on iOS if it is installed ,1
3725,0_1629, I used Google Reader to get the best posts from many blogs and share them through my own Blog hosted in Blogger ,0
3726,0_1630, Google Reader had the option Send to Blogger ,0
3727,0_1631, That is the only feature I am missing in feedly ,0
3728,0_1632, I can add my Tumblr blogs to my groups to read them but if I want to like them I have to open the page in another browser window ,0
3729,0_1633, It would be nice if we could get the Tumblr heart right in the feedly page like how we can save for later ,1
3730,0_1634, Reblog support would be nice too but mostly just like at least ,1
3731,0_1635, I know of many folks including yours truly who use Feedly in conjunction with Pocket ,0
3732,0_1636, I noticed that Buffer and Evernote each have a keyboard shortcut in the Web interface ,0
3733,0_1637, My feature request is rather straightforward add a similar shortcut for Save to Pocket ,1
3734,0_1638, for example if you want to have a feed with a particular tracked tag from tumblr Feedly could create a feed ,0
3735,0_1639, For example if you want a feed for every tumblr feed containing the hashtags hashtag retail hashtag design url would be a feedly feed ,0
3736,0_1640, The current version of your Chrome Web App does not behave correctly When you click the icon of a Chrome web app this should bring an existing open window or tab to the front or in case of a window minimize it into the Chrome Launcher or maximize it from there Feedly is web app however keeps on opening a new window or tab everytime you click on it ,0
3737,0_1641, The current version of your Chrome Web App does not behave correctly ,0
3738,0_1642, When you click the icon of a Chrome web app this should bring an existing open window or tab to the front or in case of a window minimize it into the Chrome Launcher or maximize it from there ,0
3739,0_1643, That can really drive you nuts as there is almost no other web app that does this Google being the stupid other exception of the rule ,0
3740,0_1644, Please fix this by updating the manifest json file inside the app ,1
3741,0_1645, It should be enough to make the URLs match the actual URL of the open app ,0
3742,0_1646, So in case you switch to https do use that in the manifest too ,1
3743,0_1647, Currently if there is a link to an app in the Google Play store it opens in the Feedly browser instead of using the Play app which is frustrating ,0
3744,0_1648, This is just one example of many so it seems to be a problem with opening in the browser only ,0
3745,0_1649, We should have the choice ,0
3746,0_1650, For instance Feedpress can not see how many people subscribe to feeds through Feedly ,0
3747,0_1651, Please allow some way for RSS services to get access to that data especially since Feedly is so big ,1
3748,0_1652, Right now it is a black box ,0
3749,0_1653, Fix it if you can ,0
3750,0_1654, How about giving Feedly compatibility with If This Then That ,1
3751,0_1655, Posting to Pocket via the Chrome extension is currently very laborious opens in a separate tab then loads all your Pocket stories every time ,0
3752,0_1656, Pending more straightforward integration with Pocket how about allowing us to send our entire isaved ' list straight to Pocket ,1
3753,0_1657, You reader is nearly unusable with tools that allow mouseless browsing vimperator pentadactyl please replace all links you emulated with divs eg menu on the left with real hrefs so these are found by such tools ,1
3754,0_1658, Let the content creators see that their content is viewed in your service Like url ,1
3755,0_1659, I add RSS source by click the RSS icon on the URL bar on Chrome but with feedly i can not do it ,0
3756,0_1660, Please make a way to do that ,0
3757,0_1661, Rendering is messed up in IE and ,0
3758,0_1662, I am SUPER grateful that you guys got it working at all by date but this is something that will need to be fixed ,0
3759,0_1663, When showing news as just title lines in Chrome it ' ll show title per line so to say and the st line of the article is revealed after the title or upon clicking on it ,0
3760,0_1664, In IE every news line is effectively lines line for the title then the st line of the article starts AND goes on for a full nd line ,0
3761,0_1665, This looks really weird and is quite distracting when trying to read my RSS ,0
3762,0_1666, Again super grateful you guys got it working somewhere other than Chrome a life saver since I can only use IE on my Windows RT Tablet but this needs to be fixed eventually ,1
3763,0_1667, When saving to Pocket in this case a third party app having visual feedback that the save is happening would be useful ,1
3764,0_1668, I have performed a save multiple times as it is not always instant a limitation of integrating with a third party I understand ,0
3765,0_1669, Maybe the press to save could change the item color until saved and the save icon could be disabled until it is saved ,1
3766,0_1670, Now that we have a wonderfully awesome Evernote integration it is time to make it easier to use ,0
3767,0_1671, I have quite a few notebooks and would like to be able to select one notebook as a default so I can simply click the Evernote icon and voila the article saved to my default notebook ,1
3768,0_1672, When I send content from Feedly web to Evernote the formatting comes across wonky and unclear ,0
3769,0_1673, When I send it from other similar tools like Mr Reader it comes across as an article and without the extra content from the website ,0
3770,0_1674, I wish to add content in Evernote with the clearest formatting I can so it needs to be better than Feedly currently supports ,1
3771,0_1675, Many people want you to get rid of the need for an extension and make Feedly a pure web based app ,1
3772,0_1676, So do I ,0
3773,0_1677, If you are not going to please explain why not ,0
3774,0_1678, What I really want are GMail style filters for feeds to automatically star or mark as read based on matches ,1
3775,0_1679, A typical example If article subject contains this week in mark it as read ,0
3776,0_1680, If article body contains My Name star it and send to instapaper ,1
3777,0_1681, I think IFTTT integration could get us there with not too much in the way of additions add trigger with pattern or keyword matching on subject sender body etc add ' mark as read ' as an action ,1
3778,0_1682, It should be possible to specify actions in IFTTT that mark articles as read when triggered ,0
3779,0_1683, I would like to do some action when new articles show in some categories but I do not want to see them anymore in Feedly after this action is executed ,1
3780,0_1684, Lots of blogs contains LaTeX code to display mathematical characters ,0
3781,0_1685, This should display as the characters themselves rather than just as the code ,1
3782,0_1686, dollar alpha dollar should be the Greek letter alpha and so one ,1
3783,0_1687, This would make it much easier to read philosophical and mathematical blogs ,0
3784,0_1688, Pages created with Wordpress allow this ,0
3785,0_1689, This would allow you to minimize the rights required for users interested only in the reader ,0
3786,0_1690, keyword filtering deleting articles authors not of interest prevent unwanted articles from being grabbed by IFTTT ,0
3787,0_1691, Some Tumblrs I read have passwords on them ,0
3788,0_1692, It would be great to have a way to add these feeds to Feedly by allowing us to enter the password once from Feedly ,1
3789,0_1693, Make it possible for me to open articles and links inside articles IN SAFARI from within feedly ,1
3790,0_1694, I am looking for something like this but for feedly url ,1
3791,0_1695, Create Delicious integration to allow sharing to delicious com ,1
3792,0_1696, The side area allows you to include your Facebook and Twitter feed ,0
3793,0_1697, If you are using Feedly as your homepage a quick overview of upcoming events might be nice ,1
3794,0_1698, Please let me sign in with an ID and password I chose not my google account ,1
3795,0_1699, I would like to connect articles with items in my calendar ,1
3796,0_1700, E g I read an article about concert and add an item to calendar attaching link to article ,0
3797,0_1701, Or I read an article about grant or scholarship and create calendar item for documents submission deadline attaching link to article ,0
3798,0_1702, I am limited to IE on Windows emtong at work ,0
3799,0_1703, All I get is the same white screen all the IE and IE users are complaining about ,0
3800,0_1704, Is there anything you can do to make Feedly work on IE ,1
3801,0_1705, Hi Few day ago I have started using you excelent app but one thing annoying me ,0
3802,0_1706, My favorite web page which id url is not acceptable by your app ,0
3803,0_1707, Could you fix it ,0
3804,0_1708, Hello Feedly developers here is a proposal on how to create a win win situation for readers and content creators ,0
3805,0_1709, Flattr is still not lifting mainly due to a lack off content creators willing to register themselves at flatter ,0
3806,0_1710, Also flatters prototypish content search function makes it hard for users to find proper content ,0
3807,0_1711, Feedly has a user friendly interface with a pretty reliable search function and share options to several other applications ,0
3808,0_1712, It might be an idea to add a flatter function to feedly ,1
3809,0_1713, Alternatively a simple flattr inspired donate function might do it ,1
3810,0_1714, feedly pro readers sign up for the wouldonate ' option where they can donate an amount of money for articles they liked ,1
3811,0_1715, The amount of the donation is up to the user the user pays in advance into his pro account and may spend that money for article donations ,1
3812,0_1716, As a feedback a graphical representation of number and amount of donations and how many readers have read and or donated a certain article is shown ,0
3813,0_1717, In this way the current intransparent recommendation count would become more transparent ,0
3814,0_1718, All articles can be donated too ,1
3815,0_1719, The donated money will be transferred to all publishers who are interested in getting donations similar to unclaimed flatters ,1
3816,0_1720, Bloggers Authors who want to claim their money do this by registering their rss feed and bank or paypal account at feedly ,1
3817,0_1721, After registration unclaimed donations will be transferred from donator to author ,1
3818,0_1722, feedly keeps a certain percentage of the donation as an administration fee ,1
3819,0_1723, Benefits gives readers an easy way to support the authors and content they like ,0
3820,0_1724, gives content creators an additional revenue model ,0
3821,0_1725, gives feedly an additional revenue model ,0
3822,0_1726, opens up further possibilities around subscription paid only content contributors influencing content creators etc ,0
3823,0_1727, Feedly could re invent the way we consume articles in the same way how Amazons Kindle Unlimited did with the book market ,1
3824,0_1728, An easy to use donate function might turn feedly pro into a universal news portal for fact based quality news ,1
3825,0_1729, This function might change the independent news market in a similar way as Amazons Kindle unlimited did to the book market and might attract both readers and authors to sign up for a feedly account ,0
3826,0_1730, Anyway the most important feature is to find the simplest way to transfer money from article readers to article authors ,0
3827,0_1731, Feedly could be the perfect platform for that ,0
3828,0_1732, I have two twitter accounts that I use regularly one for work and a personal account ,0
3829,0_1733, I often post to both from Feedly but this requires a lot of logging in and out ,0
3830,0_1734, Integration with Tweetdeck would allow me to easily post to either account ,0
3831,0_1735, I often want to read articles at a later time in Safari is Readling List ,0
3832,0_1736, Would love to have a direct link to do this ,1
3833,0_1737, Do you think it is possible to mod this little software Google Reader Notifier by Yonizaf url to notify us when new Feedly feeds are available ,1
3834,0_1738, Currently in browser and mobile version one has often to do two step navigation to go to original content example youtube rss for uploads in browser and mobile version it embeddes video which is not what some of us want ,0
3835,0_1739, I prefer to see original content most of the time so along with mark as read save links there could be URL link which will drive to the original site ,1
3836,0_1740, Applies to browser and mobile versions ,0
3837,0_1741, It would be awesome to play all videos one by one like in a playlist but without a hassle of creating one ,1
3838,0_1742, I often have many short videos which I have to click individually which is pretty annoying when I want to do sth else and not touch computer ,0
3839,0_1743, Feedly is a website ,0
3840,0_1744, Luakit is a browser ,0
3841,0_1745, I should be able to use feedly in luakit ,1
3842,0_1746, I understand that offline support is being worked on and can not wait to use that functionality however since Google Reader is shutting down within weeks and BYLINE reader is the ONLY offline reader currently available for commuters it would be fantastic if you could work together ,0
3843,0_1747, Unfortunately they only pull their feeds from google reader ,1
3844,0_1748, The Android app is missing a mark as unread option ,1
3845,0_1749, It would be great if you could add a link bookmark right into your Diigo account while reading in Feedly ,1
3846,0_1750, I am a blogger and I want to make it easy for people to subscribe by having a flare unit for them to add my feed to their Feedly but I simply cannot find a working flare unit to add to my feedburner ,0
3847,0_1751, And I seem to be having trouble making one of my own ,0
3848,0_1752, Please create and host a flare unit and provide the URL for bloggers to easily add this option for their readers who use Feedly ,1
3849,0_1753, Sina weibo is a service like twitter in China It has biggest market share ,0
3850,0_1754, I can use flipboard to access my feeds in sina weibo but I like feedly better so if it can be done in feedly it will be great for me ,1
3851,0_1755, Now it shows recent items which makes it unusable ,0
3852,0_1756, I cannot see more and have to go to FB website anyway so the integration is not useful at all ,0
3853,0_1757, the button to subscribe to rss with feedly in Firefox actually does nothing ,0
3854,0_1758, some articles include slideshows with article information that have to be viewed with a swipe action ,0
3855,0_1759, Because feedly is swipe action moves to the next feed it is not possible to view the slideshow ,0
3856,0_1760, Either allowing a function to go to a webpage in your internet browser outside of feedly or using another action to view the slideshow ,0
3857,0_1761, Other similar apps have this functionality it would be quite useful to my workflow at least ,0
3858,0_1762, Since you can integrate with Twitter it would be nice to have my saved links across both platforms show up in a nice readable format in Feedly ,1
3859,0_1763, I would like to have Feedly automatically detect YouTube videos in feeds and if I save a post with a YouTube embed automatically add that specific video to my ' Watch Later ' feed in YouTube ,1
3860,0_1764, This way I can pull up the YouTube app on my phone or tablet later and watch these videos on my Chromecast ,0
3861,0_1765, Make the Feedly reader browser extension more like the Google reader extension ,1
3862,0_1766, Add a drop down menu of the sources with number of unread items in list the latest unread articles in a scrollable manner and add a mark all as read button and the link to the feedly reader ,1
3863,0_1767, Maybe you could also add a link to the preferences and please make sure that clicking a link to an article marks it as read in feedly emwink Thanks ,1
3864,0_1768, Footnote popovers as used on many popular blogs and Wikipedia display the footnote itself within a pop up bar or text bubble right next to the main article text it relates to ,0
3865,0_1769, In a properly formatted RSS article the reading app will display the footnote inline and not require invoking the web browser and going online ,0
3866,0_1770, Can Feedly is RSS parser be made to not break this functionality please ,1
3867,0_1771, I want to open feeds outside of Feedly sometimes and look at the site it came from ,1
3868,0_1772, I prefer to use Chrome and it crashes constantly in Feedly on my iPAD if I browse beyond the article is page ,0
3869,0_1773, It is a more stable option that selecting Chrome as the ' preferred browser ' in Feedly ,0
3870,0_1774, Also we should have the choice I am not going to leave Feedly it is a great app ,1
3871,0_1775, Just looking for an option that let us me list my articles from oldest to newest like I have it in the on the site ,1
3872,0_1776, I am looking for a consistent experience ,1
3873,0_1777, I currently use NewsBlur but I would love to transfer all my feeds via OPML to Feedly ,1
3874,0_1778, Unfortunately Feedly is OPML support is artificially limited to Google Reader is exact OPML format but there is no reason we can not expand it to handle NewsBlur is OPML download format for importing into Feedly ,1
3875,0_1779, Let us configure the directory and file names when saving to Dropbox with tokens like year month date feed name post date etc ,1
3876,0_1780, When you click on an rss feed in firefox it shows you a preview of the current feed with an option to subscribe to it ,0
3877,0_1781, But the current add on does not add an option to the list of programs to subscribe using ,0
3878,0_1782, I have tried adding it manually but it does not work and in any case it should not be that awkward ,0
3879,0_1783, Also would be nice to petition firefox devs to have it as standard ,1
3880,0_1784, Please remove unsaved items from Dropbox or add a preference ,1
3881,0_1785, Would also mitigate this ,0
3882,0_1786, Allow all your Saved for Later items to be exported as a bookmark file in a similar format to the Firefox and Google Chrome bookmarks export tool ,1
3883,0_1787, This will allow bulk importing of saved for later items into tools like pinboard in ,0
3884,0_1788, I just cant use the chrome extrension ,0
3885,0_1789, It will not allow me to log in the window containing the form is closed as soon as the form has finished loading ,0
3886,0_1790, I love Feedly it is a really well programmed app ,0
3887,0_1791, Nevertheless there is one thing that annoys me ,0
3888,0_1792, when I press a link in an article that I am reading on feedly then the link will always open inside Feedly ,0
3889,0_1793, There is no option to open the link directly in the browser safari or in my case chrome ,0
3890,0_1794, sometimes it is necessary to open links in the browser out of convenience and sometimes for usability ,0
3891,0_1795, usually I end up opening the link in feedly wait for the site to load and then i go into the options menu to open the site once more in chrome ,0
3892,0_1796, it would be so much easier just to have a context menu item that gives the option to open a link directly in the browser ,1
3893,0_1797, Support for reading latest gmail mails directly from inbox feed just the same as igoogle ,0
3894,0_1798, When I switch in IOS to another application example to translate a word and switch back again the reader goes to a title page instead staying on the page I was reading which is not pleasant ,0
3895,0_1799, Possibly some translation functionality might be useful ,1
3896,0_1800, We can set the preferred browser on iOS this rocks ,0
3897,0_1801, However if I then click on sharing and google plus it opens in safari ,0
3898,0_1802, My suggestion is to honour the preferred browser if chosen when using more generic based web sharing services ,1
3899,0_1803, I do not need all the Pro features ,0
3900,0_1804, I would love to pay money year just for evernote integration though ,1
3901,0_1805, This function is currently available in the Gmail and Pocket iOS apps in which a button appears at the top left corner of the Chrome browser which will allow the user to quickly return to Feedly when they view a page in Chrome from Feedly ,0
3902,0_1806, More convenient than using multitask function ,0
3903,0_1807, Integration or support to work with Net News Wire for Mac and Reeder and Instapaper for iOS ,0
3904,0_1808, Recently there was a change that forced you to use a Buffer account to share to social networks such as Facebook ,0
3905,0_1809, Seems kind of pointless for those who do not have a Buffer account nor want one to have to create an account and have it be the middleman between Feedly and Facebook ,0
3906,0_1810, I LOVED the way Facebook sharing was ,0
3907,0_1811, Clean at the end of articles and available for comments before posting ,0
3908,0_1812, If it ain ' t broke do not fix it ,0
3909,0_1813, Feedly allowed mailing articles through gmail directly instead of bringing up a mail client ,0
3910,0_1814, I want that feature back as I would like to mail my articles directly ,1
3911,0_1815, The G hack does not work for mailing lists ,0
3912,0_1816, When I tag an article in feedly i want the tags to follow when iexport the article to evernote with the built in evernote feature for Feedly Pro plan ,1
3913,0_1817, As it is now when iexport with the evernote button an article i have to manually log in to evernote and ad the tag again ,0
3914,0_1818, It would be nice if we were able to view content from Twitter embeds such as images in Feedly ,1
3915,0_1819, Some libsyn feeds do not link to the libsyn item but rather the audio file directly ,0
3916,0_1820, You used to be able to right click on the item in feedly and save it ,0
3917,0_1821, Now you have to open the file and use save page as ,0
3918,0_1822, Please fix this ,0
3919,0_1823, BeeLine Reader full disclosure I am the founder has browser plugins that apply eye guiding color gradients to make reading faster and easier ,0
3920,0_1824, Over percent of people find that these gradients improve readability and the plugins work great on feedly ,0
3921,0_1825, But the BeeLine functionality could be built into the feedly UI using the BeeLine javascript library ,1
3922,0_1826, add Google as option for feed that appear on the left in the app and also in your main feed ,1
3923,0_1827, When we long press on a link in Feedly or in a web view we are given the option to add it to Reading List but not to Instapaper or any of the other Read Later services ,0
3924,0_1828, When you select a preferred RL service it should also be available when you long press a link so that you can send that link directly to your favorite service rather than having to open the link wait for it to load then send it to Instapaper or Pocket or whatever you prefer ,1
3925,0_1829, I have searched high and low Google DuckDuckGo feedly com which redirects me to my feeds from where there are no other links PimpMySafari dead link Apple is Safari Extension Gallery everywhere ,0
3926,0_1830, I see people talking about the extension all over the place but for the life of me I cannot locate a link to the damn thing ,0
3927,0_1832, The abillity to export an article or post directly to Kindle or and other e book readers ,0
3928,0_1833, In the Firefox extension selecting oldest first under change layout does not stick ,0
3929,0_1834, It keeps resetting to unchecked so the sort is newest first the next time you enter that category ,0
3930,0_1835, Import google current feeds into feedly ,1
3931,0_1836, Add ability to share whole articles to Evernote ,1
3932,0_1837, This option is very important when RSS feed contains only text excerpt ,0
3933,0_1838, make feedly more sandboxed ,1
3934,0_1839, Android Feedly Chrome ,0
3935,0_1840, I have a chrome icon in the action bar ,0
3936,0_1841, I think it is for open in browser or maybe share with chrome ,0
3937,0_1842, Anyway it would be great if this opened the currently visible article in the browser instead of the previous article ,1
3938,0_1843, That is how it used to work and I think that makes more sense ,0
3939,0_1844, Sometimes after I have clicked into an article into a Chrome tab and then clicked the Back button I end up at the Feedly app is top level rather than at the article summary ,0
3940,0_1845, I am presented with the Feedly app is splash screen along the way ,0
3941,0_1846, As is one has to open each post one wants to read later ,0
3942,0_1847, Often I have little time and just want to scan headlines and make sure the ones that seem important get into the readitlater pile ,0
3943,0_1848, Unify login feedly allowing access by more than one source or facebook or Google or Microsoft or ,1
3944,0_1849, Just depending on what the user decided accounts relate ,0
3945,0_1850, I would like the Feedly Chrome app to act just like the Google Reader one shows how many feeds I have and I can click on them individually ,1
3946,0_1851, Add the number of followers to your subscribe button like Bloglovin already does to be displayed on blogs ,1
3947,0_1852, Provide the html code with your other buttons ,1
3948,0_1853, Integrate Twitter cards on article preview page so that when viewing an article that has an embedded twitter card with all it is information it shows the card instead of plain text ,1
3949,0_1854, When I save an article to Evernote the resulting note is the text and images but not what the webpage looks like ,0
3950,0_1855, The Evernote Web Clipper allows to me save the full page but I would love to be able to do this straight from Feedly ,1
3951,0_1856, I currently use Pocket as my read later app but was hoping to move to Evernote ,0
3952,0_1857, Right now it takes clicks and navigating to another tab for saving to pocket it would be nice if it is handled in the same window with pop up or just with single click ,1
3953,0_1858, Also if it is possible to override save for later to pocket ,1
3954,0_1859, I would like to have feedly integrate with bit ly ,1
3955,0_1860, Bit ly is bookmark function combined with it is URL shortener and usage information would be really useful when sharing from feedly ,1
3956,0_1861, Please allow Chrome feedly and other browsers ' feedly to customize favourite saving tool so that I can save to pocket with one click and please also cut the settings on the pocket is end for adding a new item ,1
3957,0_1862, Would be most appreciated ,0
3958,0_1864, I currently use gRead widget to see my unread count on Google Reader ,0
3959,0_1865, It is how I get notified that there is unread items while I am on the Mac ,0
3960,0_1866, Essentially I would like to see the ability to add All to an external application such as Desktop Ticker by Mike Batt ,1
3961,0_1867, This application and gReader Pro for Android is where I pull all my news in normally and Desktop Ticker is now useless as of this morning without a way to pull Feedly or Digg Reader ,0
3962,0_1868, might have to check to see if they have it is data into it ,0
3963,0_1869, I like the feedly interface more than the Instapaper interface ,0
3964,0_1870, I would like to read my Instapaper saved articles via feedly ,1
3965,0_1871, We use Feedly and the Buffer link in a work environment ,0
3966,0_1872, I have Googled and found at the moment Feedly only works on one web browser which is Google Chrome ,0
3967,0_1873, We are limited to one browser which is Internet Explorer in our work environment so we are currently unable to use your services ,0
3968,0_1874, Please can you give us a fix or enable your program to work in IE ,1
3969,0_1875, Other user is who are using your program for work purposes will have a similar problem as it makes it difficult for IT teams to support more than one browser ,0
3970,0_1876, I would like to be able to save articles to MindSky similar to other integrations ,1
3971,0_1877, As available with their save tool url ,0
3972,0_1878, It is frustrating that I do not need to remember passwords anymore when I am using Safari but I need to exit Feedly go to Settings Safari Passwords look for the site copy password go to Feedly again and paste password ,0
3973,0_1879, Apply the awesome mobile app feature to the web interface ,1
3974,0_1880, I would love to be able to save directly to Pocket like I can on the android app ,1
3975,0_1881, all is in title ,0
3976,0_1882, when a term is added should lookup for feeds in popular RSS Feed Directories in one go ,1
3977,0_1883, This will present with more options to subscribe to ,0
3978,0_1884, As a web developer I do not like plugins that add elements to the DOM of each page ,0
3979,0_1885, Can you use a traditional address bar button ,1
3980,0_1886, simple timeline were you can add content from twitter accounts facebook sites profiles in a own categorie ,0
3981,0_1887, I am working on a feedly application and I want to add some pro features like in stream search but I am not able to test these because i do not have a pro account ,0
3982,0_1888, So my suggestion is to offer developers a switch to turn on off pro features in the sandbox ,1
3983,0_1889, Obviously this should be somehow restricted so that this system can not be abused ,0
3984,0_1890, Feedly always inserts quotation marks in posts to Buffer ,0
3985,0_1891, Please remove the quotation marks or make Buffer post template editable like already the Twitter post template ,1
3986,0_1893, The use case is that I am surfing the web and I find a site that I would like to follow ,0
3987,0_1894, I drag the url to my feedly bookmark and Feedly adds the feed to my account even better would be the ability to categorize the feed as I add it ,1
3988,0_1895, The ability to let indigo read the title of the posts perhaps with commands to marks as unread save even read the whole article Like an interactive radio ,0
3989,0_1896, You Recently added function and allowed us to save an article to Evernote that is great ,0
3990,0_1897, However Evernote is service for China is not supported ,0
3991,0_1898, Please do not abandon market in China ,1
3992,0_1899, Please remove google requirement ,1
3993,0_1900, It would be great if chrome and opera were not the only options for opening up articles in ,1
3994,0_1901, I am using your Chrome app ,0
3995,0_1902, Due to the way your article popup is positioned it is close button sits directly above the side pane ,0
3996,0_1903, Although my mouse click is properly sent to the close button any mouse movement after the popup goes away is sent to the side pane which causes it to intelligently expand and reflow the list of articles that I am trying to read ,0
3997,0_1904, It is really annoying ,0
3998,0_1905, I really love how I can browse the latest articles from all feeds on the iOS version but this does not seem to be an option on the chrome web app version ,0
3999,0_1906, I might just not be able to find the option so if someone else has anything to add then please comment ,0
4000,0_1907, Keep the awesome work up guys ,0
4001,0_1908, At some point can we get Google Keep integration to go along side Pocket ,1
4002,0_1909, That is if they have an API for it ,0
4003,0_1910, I have a jabber Account GoogleTalk ,0
4004,0_1911, I would like to receive the headlines as items arrive to my IM client ,1
4005,0_1912, As soon as I log in online your jabber bot could return to looking as defined in the settings of fresh news headlines ,0
4006,0_1913, If I am already connected the bot could write headlines with links to me upon receipt of the news in my rss subscription ,0
4007,0_1914, my facebook page is blocked by the plugin ,0
4008,0_1915, I uninstalled all plugins and I only reactivated the feedly plugin to be sure ,0
4009,0_1916, If I have a feed in a folder named COOKING I would like the IFTTT ingredient entitled ArticleCategories to return COOKING ,1
4010,0_1917, Currently it returns nothing ,0
4011,0_1918, Please make an app for blackberry playbook because there are no apps that support feedly on blackberry app world for playbook ,1
4012,0_1919, This would make integration with other stuff eg newsbeuter possible ,0
4013,0_1920, This could make the Feedly OPML a canonical source of feeds for other apps that a user wants to use ,0
4014,0_1921, Reset the RSS subscribe function after someone uninstalls your extension ,1
4015,0_1922, The current uninstall leaves several settings in your about config and makes other changes which make it impossible to subscribe using Live Bookmarks anymore ,0
4016,0_1923, I have had to switch back to Feedly just so I can subscribe to new feeds ,0
4017,0_1925, For me it actually provides a worse experience than the builtin browser it brings Chrome to the foreground and opens the link I tapped in a new tab ,0
4018,0_1926, To get back to feedly I have to back out or go into recent apps ,0
4019,0_1927, What I want is to be able to skim through my feed items and quickly open N tabs in the background then go to my browser and read through them at my leisure ,1
4020,0_1928, Having tap always open a foreground tab is okay but probably better to be configurable ,1
4021,0_1929, However if in article title view allow long press to bring up a menu ,1
4022,0_1930, open in new external browser tab ,0
4023,0_1931, at least allow configuring the action for long press ,1
4024,0_1932, A lot of the RSS feeds I read force you to go to the full site to read the full article ,0
4025,0_1933, Lifehacker is a good example ,0
4026,0_1934, One thing that would be nice is the ability to be able to hit one button to open all of the unread articles for a category in new browser tabs rather than having to click each one separately ,1
4027,0_1935, It would be nice to have a similar feature on mobile except the way it would work would be to add all of the articles to Pocket or an alternative read it later app Pocket all or something like that ,1
4028,0_1936, If i want to subscribe to tumblr blog assume rss at the end of a link I paste I now have to manually add rss to links like url to subscribe ,0
4029,0_1937, The Good read tagline is not attached to my twitter posts when I schedule the posts through buffer ,0
4030,0_1938, Please add this feature ,1
4031,0_1939, Make it possible to link an article to your Facebook business page ,1
4032,0_1940, Right now Feedly is not consistantly running across browser this needs to be investigated and fixed ,1
4033,0_1941, I work which adivertisement so i like to seeing new video ideas but when i try to see VEVO video on the feedly i never can only youtube videos ,0
4034,0_1942, I am constantly missing important content that happens in google as I do not check it regularly ,0
4035,0_1943, The unfortunate thing about this is that if I had an RSS feed I would include it in feedly but google does not offer this ,0
4036,0_1944, It would be great if there was a way to see all of the content I would see in google via the API and present it in feedly ,1
4037,0_1945, Being able to add a click feed for Facebook url would also be quite useful ,1
4038,0_1946, I have noticed that it is difficult to add new blogs that I want to follow including my own ,0
4039,0_1947, When I search for emi ito illustration or the website url nothing comes up ,0
4040,0_1948, This is the case even when I have subscribed to the blog through feedly through the feedly button on my blog ,0
4041,0_1950, would be cool if I could view the basecamp progress feed in feedly ,1
4042,0_1951, I use the saved items while on mobile to flag items for review on computer ,0
4043,0_1952, It would be nice to have an indicator on the Chrome extension icon to remind me if I have saved items to review ,1
4044,0_1953, I need Huffduffer integration to send selected audiofiles from within my rss feeds to this service ,1
4045,0_1954, Worked perfectly in Google Reader ,0
4046,0_1955, depends on connections and permits their are not just one profile related posts ,0
4047,0_1956, It requires an integration with Google API perhaps even cooperate with Google to make this specific data accessible ,0
4048,0_1957, IE VERSION ,0
4049,0_1958, With IE and later in Windows and Windows you can drag a web site URL from the address bar to the taskbar and pin the site to your taskbar for easy access ,0
4050,0_1959, This makes for quick access to the site ,0
4051,0_1960, IMO it also helps with the brand of the site as the app is front and center for the user and feels like any other application ,0
4052,0_1961, Web sites like Tweetdeck Pandora Facebook Bing etc all include this functionality ,0
4053,0_1962, Most even incorporate jump lists into the pinned site icon ,0
4054,0_1963, When viewing feeds from dribbble com I would like to have a ' Like ' button that is integrated with the ' Like ' mechanisms from their site ,1
4055,0_1964, When browsing a site with RSS and ATOM metadata header the Chroma and Firefox plugin presents a transparent button to quickly and easily allow you to add this feed to Feedly ,0
4056,0_1965, Could the same be added to Safari ,1
4057,0_1966, Having a pop up window open is pretty clunky ,0
4058,0_1967, Should just be able to click the icon and assuming the account link is active signed in send to Readability ,1
4059,0_1968, It would be really helpfull to have a feature of that shortens articles like Summly or Wavii ,1
4060,0_1969, Furthermore it ' ll have to be compatible with any RSS Feed i have in my list ,0
4061,0_1970, For that kind of feature compared with the already existing and wonderfull feedly i would love to pay because it makes my reading faster ,0
4062,0_1971, Recently the ' visit website ' launches the internal browser but it fails to load anything ,0
4063,0_1972, You can launch Safari from the internal button but then you have to bounce back and forth between apps ,0
4064,0_1973, This works fine on the iPhone but not on iPad ,0
4065,0_1974, So I am using URL for recent uploads from a YouTube account example url ,0
4066,0_1975, The page from the URL loads fine and shows recent uploads but subscribing to that URL in Feedly is missing out some videos for example I can not see video Europa Universalis IV Common Sense Multiplayer on the feed ,0
4067,0_1976, It was uploaded yesterday thought Feedly shows some videos before it and after it why that one is missing ,0
4068,0_1977, Not sure if that is YouTube only related spotted it with YT ,0
4069,0_1978, That is really bad though we might be missing some random content and noone would know about it ,0
4070,0_1979, Please use feedly users rather than google is users ,1
4071,0_1980, I suggest a Feedly to Google Calendar feature ,1
4072,0_1981, I saw a TV Preview for a Show next week and I want to be reminded regarding this feed entry ,1
4073,0_1982, It will be great if you will develop a Windows software for those who would like to read their feed on the computer ,1
4074,0_1983, Or at least make the browser extension useful Firefox add on has no use ,1
4075,0_1984, I want a one stop shop for all of these aspects of my internet life ,1
4076,0_1985, It would also mean that I dont have to try and search for the video channels im subscribed to on youtube within feedly ,0
4077,0_1986, I just click subscribe and they appear in my feedly ,0
4078,0_1987, Same for tumblr twitter and facebook ,0
4079,0_1988, Something similar to flipboard is functionality except your feed reader is immensely better than theirs ,0
4080,0_1989, I would like to plug Feedly into Mac is RSS screensaver but believe there is no way to do it ,1
4081,0_1990, I would like to be able to thumbs up or down videos from my YouTube feeds from within Feedly ,1
4082,0_1991, Also allow a YouTube video to continue to play while I scroll through the rest of my feeds ,1
4083,0_1992, Please add Evernote support to the iPhone for Pro users ,1
4084,0_1993, Why was it necessary for us all to have ,0
4085,0_1994, Cloud version but no option or explanation at any time that all my feeds have gone ,0
4086,0_1995, First of all I love feedly ,0
4087,0_1996, I would like to suggest reverting the change that was made in last version regarding the safari browser stuff ,1
4088,0_1997, I use my phone with left hand and feedly was great thumb would scroll swipe touch to open articles ,0
4089,0_1998, Once in the article whether within feedly or in safari I would press the back button top left ,0
4090,0_1999, Now the change has me reaching top right for the done button ,0
4091,0_2000, Disappointing from a ux perspective cause before it was perfect and seemless gets worse with bigger phones of course ,0
4092,0_2001, I use Evernote to store all of my note and picture from web pages ,0
4093,0_2002, It would be great to have some integration with that app ,1
4094,0_2003, Feedly v fails to post to Twitter from iOS needs to be fixed ,1
4095,0_2004, The share icon can prevent a user to click on something behind even if it is a small icon ,0
4096,0_2005, And i play some times with javascript and it is influence by my script but in the extension bar it will not bother my script anymore ,0
4097,0_2006, Same for debugging webpage ,0
4098,0_2007, And or you can make it a keyboard shortcut is ,1
4099,0_2008, Integration with offline translator dictionary is highly needed such as goldendict just add an icon to open the dictionary when pointing to a word in an artical ,1
4100,0_2009, To view the full article via the visit website or by clicking the title freezes the loading of the page within Feedly browser ,0
4101,0_2010, Add UI element a o shortcut to quickly add reference to default Evernote folder w t popup dialog or confirmation ,1
4102,0_2011, Hi I really enjoy using feedly Nextgen on Windows Phone and was excited to see the workflow with Onenote which i already use for all my other note taking ,0
4103,0_2012, However it seems that the selection of where to save any given article to Onenote on Windows Phone always uses the default section set in OneNote and not the one specified in the path when activating my onenote account ,0
4104,0_2013, I am running Windows Phone Lumia Denim on a Nokia Lumia with Nextgen Reader ,0
4105,0_2014, API connectivity to all Google Apps for Work ,0
4106,0_2015, add read later to the desktop extensions ,0
4107,0_2016, i just wish i could archive and group or send to another read later app from there to organize ,1
4108,0_2017, I have been a fan of feedly but am now losing heart ,0
4109,0_2018, I have updated my ipad and now can not use feedly with buffer at all ,0
4110,0_2019, I have tried deleting apps and different configuration but impossible ,0
4111,0_2020, Why do not you test your blasted products before launching changes ,1
4112,0_2021, you alienate your users and then impossible to get any sort of service to fix the problem ,0
4113,0_2022, To import an OPML file still shows a link to url but the link is redirecting ,0
4114,0_2023, So prey make it clear that this functionality does not exist or tell us how to import a and OPML list ,0
4115,0_2024, When I visit certain ogg based podcast feeds such as url the embedded player shows as a video rather than an audio player and the player controls do not work ,0
4116,0_2025, In order to listen to the podcast I have to open the ogg file in a new tab and use the Firefox embedded plater ,0
4117,0_2026, Need support to add articles in Pocket directly ,1
4118,0_2027, This can be added alongside Twitter Google and other buttons ,0
4119,0_2028, Like many others I want to add some Twitter feeds as RSS feeds ,1
4120,0_2029, There are several older threads on this issue with some suggestions that no longer seem to work ,0
4121,0_2030, To Feedly can you please provide this type of service perhaps within you Pro account if there are extra overheads ,1
4122,0_2031, And can you please make the formatting support direct linking from the URLs embedded in the tweets ,1
4123,0_2032, It would be good to not have to link to Twitter to get a usable URL ,1
4124,0_2033, Currently I use a workaround url but it would be nice to have this feature in feedly ,1
4125,0_2034, I am wondering what the latest solutions people are using to read Twitter feeds in Feedly ,0
4126,0_2035, When techbargain com updated their site it no longer worked with feedly ,0
4127,0_2036, I use Google Auth for both Pocket and for Feedly ,0
4128,0_2037, I can log in to Feedly that works fine ,0
4129,0_2038, I chose Pocket as my preferred saving tool ,0
4130,0_2039, When I try to save to Pocket though I get Please configure ,0
4131,0_2040, In the Pocket settings I only seem to have the ability to set a Pocket username and password ,0
4132,0_2041, I can not find any way to configure Pocket to use Google Auth ,0
4133,0_2042, Is it possible to use Google Auth to save to Pocket from Feedly on Android ,0
4134,0_2043, I want to be able to just log into Feedly and not have it log me out if I log out of Google ,1
4135,0_2044, Bring back tap saving to Pocket in iOS Apps ,1
4136,0_2045, When I use the define option in iOS in iPad deeply opens a new window instead of showing a pop up ,0
4137,0_2046, Opening the word definition ins new windows does not make sense specially in an iPad ,0
4138,0_2047, Safari seems to have broken the toolbar ,0
4139,0_2048, Is that going to be fixed ,0
4140,0_2049, Hi I go smoothly feedly web version and Android but Windows desktop not mobile I do not get I log ,0
4141,0_2050, I tried with Kara and Nextgen Reader Reader ,0
4142,0_2051, Please do not open a browser every time I want to share a post to my social networks Google Facebook ,1
4143,0_2052, Flipboard has a awesome way of doing it but your RSS management is far better ,0
4144,0_2053, Please add wiznote support as you support evernote ,1
4145,0_2054, Has not been updating Craiglist feeds for awhile even though Outlook and igHome are updating those same feeds ,0
4146,0_2055, The RSS markup of these feeds identifies the author example dc creator use that to set the author attribute for the Evernote note ,1
4147,0_2056, If author is not available than set author to name of the site or blog ,1
4148,0_2057, When using Feedly on a mobile device location information becomes available to the app as well ,0
4149,0_2058, Could Feedly also set these note attributes when exporting to Evernote ,1
4150,0_2059, Perhaps other additional attributes ,1
4151,0_2060, Tags could be good and bad depending on how a user uses Evernote ,0
4152,0_2061, That being said exporting tags as well could be a master setting someone could toggle on or off Basically improving the depth of integration with Evernote ,1
4153,0_2062, Currently Feedly Syncs with Google Reader ,0
4154,0_2063, Since Google Reader is going away on date I think it would be an awesome if Feedly sync is with TheOldReader it would be a great partnership for both of you ,1
4155,0_2064, I just noticed that when i tried to view an RSS feed from blogspot it automatically prompted Feedly to show the feed ,0
4156,0_2065, I am a web developer and I just wanted to copy the URL of the feed ,0
4157,0_2066, Is there a way to toggle this automatic feature ,0
4158,0_2067, If not can you offer it ,0
4159,0_2068, Add integration with Toodledo ,1
4160,0_2069, The new Feedly ios iPad App integration with Safari is fantastic but please allow a simple left to right swipe to take you from an article you have finished reading in Safari back into Feedly instead of having to use ' Done ' at the top of the Safari Browser ,1
4161,0_2070, I think my subject says it all ,0
4162,0_2071, My hypothesis what people read is important for a prospective employer ,0
4163,0_2072, A list of my RSS feeds should be available as a public shareable list that I can attach to a cover letter and let the company I interview for create a better picture as a person ,1
4164,0_2073, Same as an integration for linkedin ,0
4165,0_2074, Not individual articles list as a whole ,0
4166,0_2075, Think group list on linkedin ,0
4167,0_2076, Allow to pin things to pinterest ,1
4168,0_2077, If I could add individual users as a feed then I could see their updates without having to scroll through Facebook is ridiculous wall ,1
4169,0_2078, The same for Twitter ,0
4170,0_2079, Just being able to add a Twitter account and view only a single user is tweets would easily make Feedly one of the best Twitter platforms there is ,1
4171,0_2080, Please prevent duplicate saved items in Dropbox ,1
4172,0_2081, For Feedly Pro users when a PDF is generated for depositing in Dropbox for later reading that you offer an option for whether bookmarks are auto generated inside Feedly is PDF ,0
4173,0_2082, Adobe Acrobat does not allow the user to set an option to perma hide the bookmarks pane and I guestimate that percent of the PDFs Feedly Pro generates only have one bookmark the article title ,0
4174,0_2083, It is annoying to have Acrobat auto open a useless bookmark listing one entry in the reading window because it decreases the visible screen real estate devoted to rendering the PDF ,0
4175,0_2084, This is way more Adobe is UI problem than yours ,0
4176,0_2085, Feedly to Google plus causes the Feedly app to crash back to the home screen on Kindle Fire ,0
4177,0_2086, pointemy domain to feedly ,0
4178,0_2087, visitors can see url ,0
4179,0_2088, When we want to email news or feed records feedly do it via outlook it is better to send it via gmail or make an option for it ,1
4180,0_2089, I use RockMelt as browser and feedly will not load he loads just fine in google chrome but I would like to be able to use it with RockMel ,1
4181,0_2090, I would like to be able to send articles to Clipboard com ,1
4182,0_2091, Right now when you has X news articles and when you read them by scrolling for ex and then click refresh when no new articles badge not disappear it remain with X ,0
4183,0_2092, why the need Access to data on ALL websites ,0
4184,0_2093, This item can read every page that you visit your bank your web email your Facebook page and so on ,0
4185,0_2094, Often this kind of item needs to see all pages so that it can perform a limited task such as looking for RSS feeds that you might want to subscribe to ,0
4186,0_2096, Two problems I have to click twice on a YouTube video to be played ,0
4187,0_2097, After the first click the actual video shows up in a smaller region ,0
4188,0_2098, For solid users sharing often categories are organized by priority tier or other purpose not what makes most sense for social sharing and assigning tags to a specific feed ,0
4189,0_2099, This drives me crazy and feels like an invasion of privacy ,0
4190,0_2100, Is there any way to undo this ,0
4191,0_2101, Each time I use the chrome app it asks to connect to Google Reader ,0
4192,0_2102, I press ' connect ' allow it and it does not load the feeds just returns to the same login page ,0
4193,0_2103, I just reinstalled Firefox on a new machine and I can not login to Feedly via Google authentication ,0
4194,0_2104, It works fine with Chrome IE but when I click the Login link in Firefox nothing happens ,0
4195,0_2105, include outsidethenest net please ,1
4196,0_2106, At work I received an alert from Feedly that I needed to update to v of the plugin ,0
4197,0_2107, When I get home I see that my home system is running v but I can not get to feedly com regardless of what I do because the plugin knows better than me ,0
4198,0_2108, Even after I log out of feedly ,0
4199,0_2109, I have toy disable the extension ,0
4200,0_2110, Please make it possible to go to feedly com or make it possible to download an update from within the extension ,1
4201,0_2111, Hi I am not sure where i can claim problems ,0

4203,0_2113, It is equal if i use my iPad or my iphone different provider sim cards both are showing me the error that no connection is there ,0
4204,0_2114, After that i downloaded other feedly apps like Ziner they work without any problem ,0
4205,0_2115, What can i do ,0
4206,0_2116, I wish to connect feedy with social networks youtube vimeo tumblr instagram to synchronize the news and our favorites ,1
4207,0_2117, When can we command Feedly through our voice ,0
4208,0_2118, This will be an excellent advantage compared with other options ,0
4209,0_2119, Yes your are right too similar to Her the movie ,0
4210,0_2120, But I think it is necessary ,0
4211,0_2121, Come on guys Twitter is winning the battle for far ,0
4212,0_2122, I want Feedly to be bigger ,0
4213,0_2123, Feedly mini is very nice plug in for me ,0
4214,0_2124, but the feedly mini icon is not shown on the naver blog such as url or url ,0
4215,0_2125, When you tap the Pocket or Instapaper icon there is not much of a visual induction that the article has been saved ,0
4216,0_2126, Also would be nice to be able to send an article to Pocket from the list view without having to open the article ,1
4217,0_2127, Swiping the title would be a good solution ,1
4218,0_2128, When I open a feed within the internal browser and it does load the full webpage I would like to share it via email client having it imported as it is just as a reference under win using another feed reader feedly enabled and opening the mail app it does import the page so I can mail it out as it is or if you like as if I sent it to onenote or evernote as simple article ,1
4219,0_2129, just as a reference under win using another feed reader feedly enabled and opening the mail app it does import the page so I can mail it out as it is or if you like as if I sent it to onenote or evernote as simple article ,0
4220,0_2130, I am not sure if this is due to feedly app limitation or something else ,0
4221,0_2131, But text only imports with just a link as I come up with with gmail app is poor ,0
4222,0_2132, I started using a new Chrome app called Hacker Vision ,0
4223,0_2133, If flips the screen resolution so most webages have a dark back ground and fonts are light colors ,0
4224,0_2134, It is supposed to be easier on your eyes ,0
4225,0_2135, So far I am liking it but the colors are sometimes off ,0
4226,0_2136, What i have noticed is that the Feedly mini toolbar that pops up on the bottom right of web pages when i want to share the link via that mini feedly toolbar the background color and the color of the icons twitter buffer etc are all the same color ,0
4227,0_2137, Any way you can fix this ,0
4228,0_2138, is this a problem that Hacker Vision needs to address ,0
4229,0_2139, Please advise ,0
4230,0_2140, Feedly is really bad at discovering feeds when given only the URL ,0
4231,0_2141, Google Reader used to be able to do this with pretty much every URL you threw at it and it does not seem to be terribly complicated ,0
4232,0_2142, Giving this URL to feedly returns no feeds ,0
4233,0_2143, However if you manually Google what the standard format for feeds is with Wordpress and try out ,0
4234,0_2144, Which seems like something that Feedly might have been able to guess to begin with ,0
4235,0_2145, I had to turn off the Windows tray app ,0
4236,0_2146, Chrome would gradually get slower and slower a new development since Feedly asked to run the always on tray app ,0
4237,0_2147, I am sure it is the app because exiting it cleared up all the browser response problems ,0
4238,0_2148, Either fix it or make Feedly work always on without browser interference ,1
4239,0_2149, not much else to say include an icon for Flipboard ,0
4240,0_2150, Integration with other social media so I can read all the latest tweets google updates and others from with the feedly app ,0
4241,0_2151, You have a group of friends with send my favorite post writing command ,0
4242,0_2152, Currently some of the RSS items are lists of links ,0
4243,0_2153, Expected behavior when I follow one of the links find it interesting and click the Pocket icon is to save the clicked through article ,0
4244,0_2154, Instead it saves the initial RSS item ,0
4245,0_2155, Take Mike Tyson is channel for example ,0
4246,0_2156, That string UCdtNjOwfQpgVK FyOeLyzrg or any channel like that does not work with Feedly ,0
4247,0_2157, You have to go in and get the RSS via url please automate this ,1
4248,0_2159, I created a few ideas in the get satisfaction community do not remember how I got there and was very surprised never to get an answer until I realized you guys worked in user voice ,0
4249,0_2160, There appears to be a current bug with the android app and the Evernote integration ,0
4250,0_2161, For about the last week when I try to save it forces me to re login to Evernote ,0
4251,0_2162, This is one of my primary use flows and a big bummer as I use two factor authentication on Evernote ,0
4252,0_2163, I noticed several of my Facebook pages were not updating and then saw this announcement that Facebook has stopped updating RSS feeds ,0
4253,0_2164, The few that I follow are for ones where no website exists for them ,0
4254,0_2165, I love feedly for following them please find a way ,0
4255,0_2166, Hey I have feedly notifier in firefox on windows ,0
4256,0_2167, when I click the icon it just says no unread articles where it used to show lots of articles I could open in new tabs ,0
4257,912_2, as it occurs on Android and iOS ,0
4258,912_3, I cannot for example highlight a friend when I am trying to tell something to him in my post ,0
4259,912_4, Second why do not work with metro style on FB app ,0
4260,912_5, Why this common and ridiculous traditional FAcebook style ,0
4261,913_1, Why Microsoft does not close this vacuum spaces this things it really needs ,1
4262,913_2, The rotation style of metro will be awesome ,0
4263,913_3, I remember in the beginning the FB works with this pattern and unfortunately you abandoned ,0
4264,915_1, When using Internet Explorer in Windows Phone on Nokia Lumia OS I noticed that pointing to specific section of any document using hashtag name does not work from pages using frameset doctype is correctly set to HTML supporting framesets ,0
4265,915_2, To verify try clicking on any method in Java Javadoc for example open url and click through java applet AppletContext getApplet ,0
4266,915_3, Java site uses brackets in links names which is not ok but this is not related to this issue and even links without brackets do not work ,0
4267,915_4, Trial feature should be built in with auto prompted and disabling just like the Windows Store ,1
4268,916_1, If the user uninstalls during a trial if even tracks this fact and prevents them from starting a new trial later ,0
4269,916_2, Contract this with the Windows Phone world where we tell you we want trial mode but we have to track the number of days since install whether the user has purchased etc ,1
4270,916_3, If the user uninstalls and installs again later we have no idea ,0
4271,917_1, For an app that does not require a login so there is no account to tie the usage to and does not have a natural way to limit functionality adding a trial mode feels like implement and pray ,0
4272,917_2, With the two stores combining can we bring this to Windows Phone ,0
4273,917_3, Contract this with the Windows Phone world where we tell you we want trial mode but we have to track the number of days since install whether the user has purchased more ,0
4274,917_4, You can only select text as big as screen ,0
4275,917_5, If larger it doesnt scroll down so you can only select part of the text ,0
4276,917_6, If iOS and Android can do it why can not Windows Phone ,0
4277,917_7, Like all the Timer apps on Android iOS they can update the badge numbers real time giving you a true countdown timer experience ,0
4278,917_8, Why cant Windows Phone do this ,0
4279,917_9, It should be able to do this ,0
4280,917_10, Would battery experience really degrade that much ,0
4281,917_11, If so me thinks this is a fundamental flaw in the OS ,0
4282,917_12, is it possible to get a flash player for wp or Silverlight for wp more and more websites does not work by video clips ,0

4297,919_13, Since many devs these days use consider only WebKit while developing mobile websites these websites do not render good using IE which uses Trident is not much HTML compliant ,0
4298,920_1, It degrades browsing quality and I am unable to create a new browser which can fix this issue ,0
4299,920_2, UC Browser and IE are already there but they use Trident and are hopeless while browsing most of the websites that use vendor specific prefixes and non standard code ,0
4300,920_3, AnTuTu results show and score only D graphics and the whole system as it is all D gets rendered really well and almost lag free ,0
4301,921_1, Apart from these a game like Asphalt has almost the same lag as Minion Rush does while those two are quite much different ,0
4302,921_2, From these I concluded that a big part of D rendering might be a burden upon CPyou while GPyou does not do much ,0
4303,921_3, Is that right ,0
4304,921_4, Add podcasts as new data resource in windows phone studio app website ,1
4305,922_1, there should be mechanism that code can read installed apps ,1

4316,926_3, I love one note because of it is fast cross platform sync i feel when i am on a call and want to take notes adding a button in the dialer Loudspeaker mute hold add call to open OneNote will help me open it easily ,0
4317,926_4, When it is opened from a call then OneNote can get information on the call details Person who is on call time etc which would enable easier understanding ,0
4318,926_5, Similarly this idea could be thought through for integration of One Note with other Native applications like Camera Messaging etc ,0
4319,926_6, I want to be able to control the balance of the audio I play back with the BackgroundAudioPlayer ,1
4320,926_7, There is no good reason for not allowing this so please add it ,1

4325,926_16, The build in WP LongListSelector will jump to the last item added when data loading ,0
4326,926_17, When used in combination with MVVM and sorted data this will result in the fact that the LLS is positioned at the bottom of the list when all data is available ,0

4336,927_6, Native video player and support for subtitle If I am right the native video player doesnt support subtitle file srt ,0
4337,927_7, It would be real help in increasing user experience ,0
4338,927_8, It is a common scenario for the user to initiate a network transfer then turn off the screen or switch to another app while the transfer is still in progress ,0
4339,927_9, Apps should get at least seconds of background processing time to complete such network transfers and process the response ,1
4340,927_10, I am aware that the Background Transfer Service is available but there are cases where this is not usable because it requires the data to be transferred to be written to temporary files in the storage ,0
4341,927_11, This is also a capability that other mobile platforms have and I think it is needed to build quality apps with a good user experience ,0
4342,928_1, I completely understand the need for restrictions on background processing to help preserve battery life and responsiveness but Windows Phone is currently too restrictive ,0
4343,928_2, This is also a capability that other mobile platforms have and I think it is more ,0
4344,929_1, It would be very useful to be able to prepair a MMSComposeTask in the same way that we today could use the SMSComposeTask ,1
4345,930_1, Being able to prepare an MMS for the user would have many usages and the functionality are readily available on other platforms ,0

4351,933_1, To use the search button for any application in order to avoir to add everytime a custom search functionality ,0
4352,935_1, When a phone is reset or replaced restoration o installed apps in quite cumbersome ,0
4353,936_1, The Store lists purchase history but a re installation must be done one by one and b the list does not indicate which apps have been removed example ,1
4354,937_2, Would be cool to have an app or even better a command in the Store app that saves a list of currently installed apps after each Install Uninstall so that the user can re install all the apps as easily as updating of a number of apps takes place now ,1
4355,938_1, After finishing the call it does not show the call history about how much time it we talked ,0
4356,938_2, In the dashboard when you are uploading images in the app description it does not work for me as I am percent sure there is a timeout implemented in the uploading code ,0
4357,939_1, I can upload the smaller promotional images fine but the larger sceenshot pngs will not upload ,0
4358,939_2, Yes my internet upload speed is slow but the site should function for slow upload speeds also why not ,0
4359,939_3, The same goes for the app uploading itself a larger timeout is there but there is still a timeout that assumes a reasonably fast upload speed which not everyone has ,0
4360,939_4, Everyone in the USA has nice upload speeds possibly but not worldwide and I presume Microsoft would wish to enable developers from other countries also to be able to use their dev center ,0
4361,939_5, Just remove the timeouts completely or at least increase all timeouts by a factor of at least it is not a big deal to implement ,1
4362,939_6, Everyone in the USA has more ,0

4373,941_5, Invariably some users resort to posting negative reviews which actually are questions to the developer that the developer can not answer directly because of the way nature of the Reviews ,0
4374,941_6, I would like to see a simple change to the Rate and Review page near the bottom ,1
4375,942_1, Just add a small text blurb like If you are experiencing problems with this application please consider sending feedback instead along with a link to launch an email to the support email address ,1
4376,943_1, To go step further making the support email process anonymous would probably convince more people to use the support system ,1
4377,943_2, Set up a brokerage system whereby the developer never sees the users live email address and instead replies to a proxy email set up per user ,0
4378,943_3, To go step further making the support email process anonymous would probably convince more people to use the support more ,0
4379,943_4, Allow screen capture to be taken from background task OR through mdm protocol ,1
4380,944_1, This is useful for techs using mdm systems for example if a user has an issue and calls their tech support they can request a screen capture and help them resolve ,0
4381,945_1, Implement a free app of the week deal like apple does with ios ,1
4382,945_2, Create a SubClass of Panel that allows AbsolutePositioning of it is children yet honours the layout bounds imposed by it is own parent unlike Canvas which is unlimited in Size and must be clipped to stop the overflow of any children ,1

4389,945_9, Full support for the Applr Earpods ,0
4390,945_10, It is nearly impossible to edit videos recorded by the phone on the isolated storage it should not be this hard ,0
4391,945_11, One has to write it is own libraries simply to encode and decode videos and access the frames let alone manipulate them and do something useful ,0
4392,945_12, Even with native code support on WP it is very time consuming to port existing libraries to do this ,0
4393,945_13, I think it would be much easier to just provide APIs for the hardware encoder decoder to edit videos on isolated storage and with better performance ,1
4394,945_14, A collegue of mine with an Android Smartphone has just showed me on this Phone an Android Launcher called Launcher url What I saw was a Windows Look and Feel and much much more functionality than my Windows Nokia Lumia has ,0

4407,946_13, Can Microsoft take Advertising support seriously and provide world wide Ad promotion and delivery ,1
4408,947_1, As it is Indie Developers have lost confidence in Microsoft efforts in PubCentre Bing Ads and are moving to different Ad controls and investing into Android and iOS Platforms until Microsoft starts to demonstrate that it is serious about providing revenue performant Adversting services ,0
4409,947_2, We would like a WiFi CSP so we can configure users WiFi this is useful from an IT tech user perspective ,1

4429,949_2, Users need to vote most votes get done ,0
4430,950_1, You need simple groups ,0
4431,952_1, Regardless of votes group or technical people should check them regularly for ideas and bundle them together in a service pack ,0

4446,955_2, I think that would be useful if we can get the number of reviews and avarage rating by country in the Dev Center Report ,1
4447,955_3, Sometimes reviews can be for previous versions of the app ,0
4448,955_4, This can lead to some confusion about complaints in the reviews and whether they were fixed or not ,0
4449,957_1, Many times I have read reviews for apps and decided to not get it because I was unsure whether it was listened to and fixed or not ,0
4450,957_2, iOS has this implemented in their store and I believe it works great ,0

4453,958_2, The Windows Phone emulator should include the ability to manage VM snapshots for Windows Phone images ,1
4454,958_3, Developers should be able to create WP images that are tailored to be in a specific state and manage those image snapshots ,1
4455,959_1, Hyper V is a powerful VM management tool and it includes the ability to create new images and manage snapshots within them allowing developers to save the current state of the VM example to manage particular testing scenarios such as upgrading the app when a good amount of custom data is in it either for one app or multiple or to roll the state back to a prior checkpoint marked in the VM ,0
4456,959_2, Emulator image tooling should be expanded to include the following Create a new developer VM image from one of the base images Delete a created developer VM image Be able to add remove developer VM images from the Visual Studio device emulator list Additional tooling in the emulator to allow for snapshot management of developer VM images Under this suggestion the developer should be unable to manage or modify the base standard images this suggestion is only for adding additional images ,1

4460,960_1, I would like to have an option for each SkyDrive folder to make them available offline ,1
4461,960_2, Because not everywhere in the countryside or even in cities a good network connection is available ,0
4462,960_3, So those folders could be downloaded completely to the phone when a Wi Fi is available to access them offline later ,0
4463,960_4, Hi Instead of writing elaborate SyncML services I would like to do the same using push notification like what is happening in iOS ,0
4464,960_5, We can still have DM client and the DM client can react to push messages provided the device is enrolled ,0
4465,960_6, Push Notification Free Options like GCM Google cloud message ,0
4466,960_7, It is imperative for certain apps that some form of persistent background connectivity be allowed ,0
4467,960_8, I appreciate the need reducing wastes of battery power but if Microsoft believes in putting the user in control then allow the user to enable access to persistent TCP connections on an app by app basis as Windows allows ,0
4468,960_9, Inefficient apps can then be disallowed by the user while still enabling experienced developers the flexibility to offer apps for legacy protocols that can not be converted to a push notification system among other users ,0
4469,960_10, The GZipStream class should be available for Windows Phone developers so we do not have to rely on rd party libraries to compress and decompress streams ,1
4470,962_1, You should put the shuffle repeat and like buttons in the pop up music menu ,1
4471,963_1, I would like to see a single finger swipe across the entire navigation button area act as an app switch gesture ,1
4472,963_2, Coming from webOS navigation on wp feels very stilted ,0
4473,963_3, Simply put full swipe from right to left would swap to the next app in the back stack while a full swipe from left to right would swap to the previous app in the back stack ,0

4478,964_3, It will be great to have an option to disable the infinite looping of Pivot and Panorama controls and use them in a similar way like Picture Article browsing etc ,1
4479,964_4, Having users enroll their phone using the same mdm client no matter the vendor is a nice idea ,0
4480,964_5, However if an IT tech is using the same mdm vendor across all platforms the enrollment experience is then totally different ,0
4481,964_6, We would like to make the enrollment process consistent for our users ,0
4482,964_7, Can we have an API to enroll the device through an app or allow mdm enrollment to initiate through a browser download ,1
4483,965_1, The idea of background agents expiring if they have not been ' re initialized ' in two weeks makes sense ,0
4484,966_1, However in some scenarios they do not make sense ,0
4485,966_2, We have a company hub app that is downloaded after mdm enrollment this hub app uses a background task to post back some device info and location which is not available through the mdm protocol ,0
4486,966_3, There is no user interaction here so we would like to be able to set the expiry to never for our background tasks in this scenario ,1
4487,966_4, The only workaround just now is to keep track of when tasks were set up and send the user a toast to get them to click and activate the app ,0
4488,966_5, The only workaround just now is to keep track of when tasks were more ,0
4489,966_6, After installing the GDR dev preview on my Lumia there have been instances where my phone will restart after trying to open an app or save a contact ,0

4515,967_16, What do you think ,0
4516,967_17, It would be good to know not only the number of downloads but also how many are active still ,1
4517,967_18, If you have seen the google store they show active installations more prominently than total download count and that actually makes sense considering the amount of trash apps going around in all the phone o s ,0

4764,1032_12, Currently when using WriteableBitmap or decoding image data you have to do that on the UI thread ,0
4765,1032_13, This is very problematic since if you need to do any heavy image processing you are slowing the UI and negatively affecting the user experience ,0
4766,1032_14, It would be great if there were specific classes that could be instantiated on non ui threads and then loaded by ui thread image objects ,1
4767,1032_15, Extend push notification background task api is to allow storage of incoming push notification messages repeating of a notification as frequently as every minutes repeating the notification indefinitely until cleared by user ability to specify sounds and volume ,1
4768,1033_1, Basically I have been attempting to write a pager style alerting application to notifying me of critical IT issues and the need it to be able to wake me ,0
4769,1033_2, The currently limitations of api is prevent this type of app ,0

4783,1040_1, Please unify the Windows Phone Blue and Windows development compleatly ,1
4784,1040_2, It is good that you started this unification with the common core ,0
4785,1040_3, But it should be common on all sense not just on general things but also on UI XAML code ,0
4786,1041_1, There are a lot of patterns out there and it is not too hard to think yourself a good new design pattern which unify the UI development for example ,0
4787,1043_1, It is ok that some things will be awailable on Windows devices which are not available on Windows Phone and vice versa ,0
4788,3, Please support multi segment path for this method or at least return a message giving more details ,1
4789,19, change bit in ZIP files to better comply with ISO time and normative APPNOTES from PKWARE in order to interoperate with other unzip software ,1
4790,25, Your app must not contain or display content that a reasonable person would consider pornographic or sexually explicit ,1
4791,26, Pornographic and sexually explicit needs to be well defined ,1
4792,30, Furthermore Age Ratings in Dev Center Dashboard can be set per app according to the content in the app ,1
4793,31, If the app fills out this information there it should not be taken down unless it has pornographic or sexually explicit material which is not well defined in store policies ,1
4794,41, Would it be too much to ask for an API that wraps whatever mechanism is required to accomplish this ,1
4795,64, A container for starting applications inside it on Windows IoT Core instead of full screen ,1
4796,67, Providing separate x and y factors would enable it to be used on objects without fixed aspect ratios ,1
4797,71, With separate x and y scale measurements both objects could be resized via pinch stretch ,1
4798,75, You can use Wireshark to inspect packets and see that queries having a class of ANY will be answered by a DNS SD registration from Bonjour but will not be answered by the above DNS SD registration ,1
4799,78, Create an api that takes as an argument a command as a STRING ,1
4800,79, And using that string the api may activate the command like cortana does when you say Hey cortana MY COMMAND but without voice interaction ,1
4801,96, It would be a huge advantage to support this attribute also on the App object in the App xaml file and to make this the ultimate root ,1
4802,98, Allow license assignment for an application to be tied to Azure AD group similar to how licenses in Office can be managed ,1
4803,102, I want to create windows service which runs in background and checks if any bar code is scanned whenever a bar code is scanned I want the windows service to handle it and write the input to the text file ,1
4804,109, Please make the Fluent design toolkits available for Affinity Designer ,1
4805,111, Would be great if setter had Delay property to only execute it after a certain amount of time ,1

4807,115, add stopwatch controller ,1
4808,116, i want to add clock controller visually to show time ,1
4809,118, Add PrinterController that was in WPF and WinForms ,1
4810,120, Is there anyway you could make Windbg Preview available for offline downloading ,1
4811,135, I would like to add Bixby to this list ,1
4812,152, Why do not build a phone powered by Android but running customized by Microsoft itself ,1
4813,154, Also if Cortana can read reply messages from the phone why not link that API or process not sure if those are the words needed for my idea to the Messaging app that comes built in on W ,1
4814,158, And also it will be great the Microsoft expands it services internationally like for example Cortana which it barely works in regions outside the US ,1
4815,160, I hope that Microsoft pay attention to this and do something because I would like to see them making it is way in the mobile department ,1
4816,161, PD All Microsoft apps should be native on the phone and you should also build up a mobile text messaging app that sync with the messaging app on Windows ,1
4817,173, Could you please increase the maximum size or better remove it at all ,1
4818,186, Because of this I would like the functionality to only execute the SelectedItem code when a row is DoubleTapped ,1
4819,188, My proposed solution is to add a RowDoubleTapped event directly to the UWP DataGrid class itself ,1
4820,205, I would like to add a AnimatedHeaderedTextBox control to the Toolkit ,1
4821,216, Get back the Offiline Symbols download ,1
4822,261, Would it be possible to enhance the loading control to disable navigation when it is running ,1
4823,265, Most of the screen a wide so why not a horizontal layout for ColorPicker ,1
4824,302, As a developer I want to see the screenshots and logs my customers are sending to me via the Feedback Hub ,1
4825,311, Upon a person next logging into the device it would be nice to be able to have the app restart automatically too ,1
4826,313, I would like to see a way for any UWP app to opt in to being automatically restarted when the user logs in after a shutdown caused by an automatic reboot ,1
4827,314, Having the app receive activation parameters that indicate the cause of the restart would be great for this too ,1
4828,315, It would allow the app developer to track why the app was restarted but more importantly it would allow for the app to provide a better experience that allows the user to continue where they last left off with the app running and at a specific position in the app ,1
4829,339, Nav View should be made a full proof solution for developers ,1
4830,340, Nav View should be more integrated to the application so that the app is consistent ,1
4831,365, This info should be mandatory IMHO ,1
4832,370, It would be great if I could have two WebView each having a different user profile ,1
4833,372, A command like ms settings utilities would be very useful ,1
4834,381, For example an IsSelected property could be added to a TreeViewNode or a function like selectNode TreeViewNode to the TreeView ,1
4835,384, So ever event handler must be like one touch behaver of user ,1
4836,386, I think Microsoft should add a new property to FontIcon that combines FontFamily and Glyph into a single Uri Property call it GlyphUri ,1
4837,391, Further I think nuget should maintain a set of tags on all their properties one of these tags should be Font Icons so that when you click Download New Font it is going to search nuget for this Font Icon tag and list the packages for fonts from most popular to least popular ,1
4838,392, Also I think NuGut should maintain User Comments for each package and a star rating so that people can get an idea if the package is any good without installing ,1
4839,400, Could you add the link for the feedback hub to the store is app review form ,1
4840,401, I believe that the ' app review ' and ' report for developers ishould be divided ,1
4841,405, Is it possible to add the note to the review form as following ,1
4842,418, We need to open the window as maximized ,1
4843,420, Please provide a way to configure the size of the window in the LaunchUriForResultsAsync method ,1
4844,436, Take sample from here url ,1
4845,444, Run application and set breakpoint ReadAsync method after line ,1
4846,488, If you are also using PInvoke Kernel dll please install the nuget package directly to the UWP project automatic references added by other nuget packages like computerLCrypto add an older version verify the version of PInvoke Kernel dll in your bin x Debug build output folder it should be at least ,1
4847,497, Microsoft should give us the possibility to download created app packages for failed certification processes for further debugging ,1
4848,509, Suggestion for Pathicon DataUri Property for loading PathIcon from a Svg File instead of specifying messy vector strings nobody really wanted to put this stuff F M L in their xaml ,1
4849,512, Another possibility is to allow DataUri to point to a text file holding this type of stuff F M L ,1
4850,515, Would be nice if you could drag your file from the Project Tree over to a Xaml property requiring an ms appx 😕 path and it would expand to an ms appx 😕 path instead of a fullpath to the file on your filesystem ,1
4851,520, This would be well placed in the task manager Performance tab a dedicated usage graph could be displayed for ML activity ,1
4852,524, Would be nice if you could set the height of a TextBox using number of Lines ,1
4853,533, And it can be made percent backwards compatible with Height property in Pixels ,1
4854,537, Also HeightLines should automatically set AcceptsReturn property to true to make it super easy to create a multi line textbox in XAML ,1
4855,538, I also think there s something a little bit weirld about the textbox control if you specify lines height it should say lines in height and not expand box it should just beep when you get to the end of the lines of course it would be line if they built the scrollbars into the control then it would auotmatically scroll when exceeding the lines but i will leave that for another complaint after they add a lineheight property to make it work the way people want it to work ,1
4856,546, The reason why it is a good idea to add a HeightLine property is that it allows everything to be done in XAML setup the FontSize FontFamily and the Pixels size automatically to expand to match exactly lines ,1
4857,563, From now onward please add Sync methods first and optionally add supplementary Async method for long operations ,1
4858,567, They are a welcome addition to the API but they should not be the only way to obtain data ,1
4859,588, It would be good to have an option in xbox device portal so that we can see the javascript console logs like network logs in HTTP monitor tab ,1
4860,589, Also it would be great if there is an option to inspect and debug ,1
4861,594, for example I can add some text or anything I please on the side instating how far is this point to the current GPS location ,1
4862,596, In webview we can do panning by moving with fingers and zooming by pinching smooth and fluid ,1
4863,605, I think we should take it one step further and make Notepad opensource like Powershell so the open source community can continue to add features to Notepad to become the go to text editor for performing quick edits of programming ,1
4864,606, It would be useful for Notepad to update from being a win app to a UWP one ,1
4865,607, In keeping with current MS strategy of bringing cross platform apps to the Windows Store making Notepad one of these would be extremely helpful ,1
4866,614, It would be convenient to have a SelectedBackground property for CalendarView ,1
4867,647, Please check these links where users discussed similar issue ,1
4868,653, InputPane should not be opened and closed again and again for each input element ,1
4869,654, There should be option of preventing Auto hiding when getting focus through Tab button of InputPane just like PreventKeyboardDisplayOnProgrammaticFocus which is also not working in UWP Target Version ,1
4870,657, Enable D application developers to easily use D volumetric content in XAML Composition by configuring spatial scenes and manipulating transforms and skeletal animations ,1
4871,658, Add a panel that allows to create a design with constraints and support in Blend ,1
4872,664, I would like the ability to filter the call stack when trying to trace a function call ,1
4873,667, Essentially make it as searchable as the solution explorer with the ability to add some exclusion rules ,1
4874,691, Bring WebView with Edge to WPF and WinForms applications ,1
4875,698, and now that i am in my is Iam still playing and building but my mother and her friends cant keep up with windows they are having a hard time finding there way around windows please give them back the old windows that they can navigate ,1
4876,701, Now that Windows has LTE support RCS Messaging API should be introduced so we can take advantage of this messaging protocol in our UWP apps ,1
4877,707, Attach devices to another and ensure it full loading ,1
4878,709, Hot unplug and wait about s ,1
4879,724, Now my idea All controls could have a default property for localization ,1
4880,726, An attribute could be used to identify the default localization property for a Xaml Control ,1
4881,729, It might be placed in a MenuFlyout in a Button in a AppBarButton ,1
4882,737, Maybe at least if using the simplified FoldDown mode panning other file formats could be supported ,1
4883,738, In webb for HoloLens Running apps section should have a column that tell the user account under which a app process is running ,1
4884,744, I would like to ask Microsoft Developers to fix this issue and provide couple extra degrees of freedom going through the RDC ,1
4885,755, I think we can support this by adding a simple constructor that takes in the same parameters as Initialize ,1
4886,772, Add LoginHint as optional param to LoginAsync and plumb through GetUserTokenV Async ,1
4887,783, So it would be great to have access to this values to stay on track with actual developments from other vendors ,1
4888,785, Introduce functionality so that MAC address can be obtained programmatically ,1
4889,789, Another possiblity is to add an Attribute to Button called ,1
4890,800, if custom tiles are being displayed get the watermark s associated with them ,1
4891,801, Since we are passing a string via the x Bind attribute to some UI controls it would be nice if we could make the binding to a ReadonlySpan T so we avoid allocations ,1
4892,803, You could rename the Windows Mobile to Windows Watch and you could stop making the Lumia mobile phones but you could start making Lumia Smartwatch with Windows Watch ,1
4893,805, It needs to work as good as the one available in winmm dll ,1
4894,810, Please add a semi automated test queue mode to Driver Verifier where you can select a group of drivers and then have Driver Verifier test them one at a time moving down the queue one position with each reset or reboot ,1
4895,813, An automated test queue would be wonderful in a situation like this ,1
4896,818, Please look into how musicians and developers use MIDI and what we would like to be able to do with devices like the Surface and prioritize giving us the ability to innovate here ,1
4897,822, The SwipeControl control should support mouse input as well as touch input ,1
4898,828, I personally would like to be able to have a similar arrangement in my own apps but currently am unable to do so ,1
4899,840, resize the windows explorer window to something like px to px ,1
4900,844, To fix it just resize the window to a bigger proportion of the screen when is not fullscreen and then maximize it again ,1
4901,855, Add an option to let user do so ,1
4902,856, It might make sense to have that option in Task Manager since it is the tool to control startup tasks in Windows ,1
4903,857, Adding an image editor to CaptureElement control with these options Ability to save captured image as predefined image types jpg png etc ,1
4904,867, How about an option to automatically delete the automatic checkpoint when the machine starts ,1
4905,871, Add store uri schema like ms windows store 😕 assoc AppExt q to search app extensions ,1
4906,873, It would be useful if this feature can be supported in Windows ,1
4907,877, I want the screen setting to be an option where I can set my preferance as a default ,1
4908,882, It would be great if we could chain functions together in x Bind to create more complex expressions ,1
4909,884, Rather than writing a specific function for this purpose it would be nice if it could be composed of individual pieces that can be combined in many more ways ,1
4910,895, It would be good if we could submit utility tools to the store as there is no way to perform these tasks without admin ,1
4911,896, Maybe warn the user when downloading the app or more stringent verification process for these apps but do not block them completely as you are hurting both devs and users ,1
4912,898, With the publisher in the manifest locked to the developer name as well this should be implemented to make UWP apps much easier to distribute outside of the store ,1
4913,900, Please improve the app submission process for internal beta testing ,1
4914,907, provide a lock to the tiles so that the tiles will not get collapsed accidentally ,1
4915,908, button to right click and left click in the touchpad of continuum control display in mobile will be very helpful ,1
4916,909, I have more than apps in the store and would like to see all downloads of these apps as a number ,1
4917,929, But I hope my suggestion will be passed to where it can be the most helpful ,1
4918,932, The first feature I wanted to suggest is that I believe Cortana is lacking certain capabilities on Apple iOS specifically the ability for Cortana to send emails from the Cortana App directly by Outlook for iPhone ,1
4919,933, Similar to how Cortana handles text messages it would be nice if Cortana could draft an email onto Outlook for the iPhone ,1
4920,934, The second insight I would like to provide for feedback is on the Cortana is speech recognition on Apple iOS and Android and user input ,1
4921,939, However I would still appreciate being able to see a text message notification I have received on my iPhone from Cortana ,1
4922,956, VR is not just wanted for gaming but for business apps too ,1
4923,979, Suggestion If the returned StorageFile class could not provide the actual entry of the choices selected by the user maybe the FileSavePicker could do it with a read only property or method after the user confirmed the file ,1
4924,988, M dollar could try again to develop great software again as many years before which your customers want to install themselves because it is just fun to work with and it brings great benefits to users ,1
4925,991, The could start with small things like this feedback Form which is annoying too ,1
4926,1002, TrySetWallpaperImageAsync only supports a primary display rather than allowing the wallpaper to be set for any attached displays ,1
4927,1004, Add a iswitch istatement for XAML which allows app developers to modify parts of a layout based on a value ,1
4928,1010, I would like to add the functionality myself or contribut if somebody could help me ,1
4929,1015, I think MS needs to provide more support for schools thinking about cloudbook using Windows s ,1
4930,1017, I would like a user voice where we can request certain software be added to the windows store ,1
4931,1018, I would like students to be able to install Scratch and Sketchup for example ,1
4932,1022, But it would be good for MS to approach in reverse based on school feedback ,1
4933,1036, Update apps same time as IOS and Android updates theirs ,1
4934,1038, Include gestures that could allow users minimize apps for example with three fingers ,1
4935,1064, please set some heat sensing app by default in your Windows before it is too late ,1
4936,1066, Set a multi alarm software so that it can cope coming world situations ,1
4937,1068, Let us make a different type of OS which can understand and not only communicates with the user ,1
4938,1088, It would be extremely helpful if we could create a custom dictionary word list constraint as we can already with Speech recognition as it was possible in the old Microsoft Ink API ,1
4939,1107, Please add windows update to default rules ,1
4940,1120, Please un hamstring Windows and support Process Isolation for Containers ,1
4941,1131, Please allow that API in in background ,1
4942,1132, Microsoft should re enable the Windows Bridge for Android ,1
4943,1135, Get public tweets without user is authentication ,1
4944,1137, Take any XAML page add a button to it and bind it to any normal as in not a command on the view model ,1
4945,1138, Compile the app and the Xaml compiler throws the exception ,1
4946,1152, With proper hooks many different scenario variations could be achieved ,1
4947,1154, Let us say there is a app which display news stories ,1
4948,1165, In my opinion developers should not have to do this to prevent multiple unintended events from a control ,1
4949,1166, We need a fix to ensure that the contol stops forwarding click events after it has been clicked multiple times without manually adding code to each and every async handler ,1
4950,1178, Closing the StreamSocket by disposing deleting it should stop all the pending asynchronous operations reads or writes ,1
4951,1181, It would be nice it there was an API Discovery endpoint ,1
4952,1183, Adding Visibility property on Expander and making the header Invisible will make the panel looks like it is sliding into the view ,1
4953,1189, Allowing UWP access packaged COM will eliminate this overhead allow simpler architecture and allow re use much more traditional win apps ,1
4954,1193, Hi you really need to fix the Xbox App store ,1
4955,1203, At the very least publishing on Xbox should be an opt in function when publishing not an opt out one ,1
4956,1211, It would be nice if you also ported the ads into UWP APIs so that they can be used with Desktop Bridge apps ,1
4957,1216, Please add WMI support on UWP ,1
4958,1225, These APIs ought to be allowed for any UWP application but are most useful when working with runtime code generation ,1
4959,1237, I would like to see an API to create virtual MIDI ports built into Windows ,1
4960,1238, The Surface touch screen has tons of possibilities as a MIDI controller but this currently requires installing a rd party driver which is not a great end user experience ,1
4961,1239, Built in RtpMIDI would be nice too but at least this would be achievable without a kernel mode driver if we had virtual MIDI ports ,1
4962,1254, Allow UWP applications to tick a box in the appxmanifest declaring it as a full trust desktop application ,1
4963,1255, Prevent full trust apps from targeting phone and Xbox if you have to ,1
4964,1260, If it is an issue virtualize the registry as with the Desktop Bridge ,1
4965,1262, Look the concept of UWP apps can run on your phone RIP and your Xbox while admirable is not practical for most applications ,1
4966,1268, Show a notice to users upon install more ,1
4967,1271, It would be nice to have an attached property for ScrollViewer to set middle click scrolling ,1
4968,1289, Code would be useful in adapting to Bluetooth applications ,1
4969,1299, Check the Create date on the file ,1
4970,1303, Wait one minute so the clock shows a new minute and the run the code again ,1
4971,1309, If you go into the Explorer and delete the file and create it in explorer with the same name the create date is correct ,1
4972,1323, Following the comments on the blog post for AF UNIX it would be nice to see SOCK SEQPACKET and or SOCK DGRAM support ,1
4973,1333, I would like to vote to have this feature be configurable in settings allowing users to disable this feature ,1
4974,1340, Please add support for Cryptuiwiz API to handle timestamp reply ,1
4975,1346, Can not the reason of revocation of extended execution be a little more specific than SystemPolicy ApplicationClosing ApplicationSuspended ,1
4976,1349, In UWP Project follow XAML code make a Win Exception when minimum target is build ,1
4977,1359, Allow copy paste in settings pages for path instructions AND especially in Failure Error outcomes for self repair fix research lookups ,1
4978,1367, It is possible to disable suggestions in the settings but I guess apps should be able to disable this themselves ,1
4979,1379, will be possible to share the roadmap on the LCOW improvment ,1
4980,1385, Grouping another optional feature to enable grouping on basis of a string property of the items ,1
4981,1396, Search bar a top search bar attached to the control which can be enabled disabled with a boolean property ,1
4982,1404, One of the problems in here is Unity code which is mostly made to be single instance but it would be great to have support to launch multiple instances of the same app ,1
4983,1417, I would like to add ItemClick event to the Carousel control to be able to use it as Item listing control with the ability to click on items like in the GridView and ListView ,1
4984,1423, So please remove this restriction ,1
4985,1425, If this is a privacy constraint then please consider to add a capability that can be declared in the app manifest ,1
4986,1426, Based on this it also could notify the user at first app start like it is done with the camera access ,1
4987,1436, MarkdownTextClock should provide LinkCommand alongside LinkClicked event ,1
4988,1438, It would be good if TextBoxRegEx will be automatically delete letters at input like the TextBoxMask ,1
4989,1439, Maybe a new ValidationMode type would make sense here ,1
4990,1440, Can you add the D Viewer object that is used by Paint D and Mixed Reality Viewer ,1
4991,1441, Include the mouse and keyboard support ,1
4992,1442, Make it available for Net WPF also and via nuget ,1
4993,1448, Please add an overload to create a MediaStreamSample from a D D Surface ,1
4994,1451, But it would be even better if we could configure the compiler somehow through a special screen in the properties or through an optional configuration file ,1
4995,1452, In such a configuration we could enter for example default binding modes for specific dependency properties like for example TwoWay for TextBox TextProperty ,1
4996,1461, Get rid of the EmailMessage Body character limit ,1
4997,1462, If you have such limits publish them in the API docs ,1
4998,1472, The aforementioned forum post suggests using a remote API as a work around ,1
4999,1475, Please give developers the option to not participate in the upcoming sets feature ,1
5000,1481, Recommendation ContentDialog should do the locking so that the user does not have to ,1
5001,1489, To have a dialog that can be used at any time and that always shows centered on the main window of the app you must have two copies of the dialog one embedded in XAML and shown using InPlace but only if it is loaded and the other not embedded in XAML and shown using Popup ,1
5002,1491, Recommendation add a parameter to ShowAsync that positions the dialog relative to the main window of the app centered left right bottom ,1
5003,1495, Since only one ContentDialog can be shown at a time a lock is needed such as SemaphoreSlim or a sequential queue of TaskCompletionSource ,1
5004,1503, But it would be nice to choose what elements get discarded first in case there is is not enough space on the tile ,1
5005,1509, When declaring a custom Template for ContentDialog the template root must contain a Border with x Name Container otherwise the ShowAsync method will throw a System AccessViolationException ,1
5006,1517, So I propose a download archive for Windows Insider Preview SDKs where we can download earlier versions of the Preview SDKs ,1
5007,1522, The expected behaviour is that when you click on the Primary or Secondary button in a ContentDialog then focus should be switched to the button concerned otherwise x Bind bindings wont update ,1
5008,1529, Please make registration posible for Moldova ,1
5009,1542, Please extend KeyFrameAnimations ScalarKeyFrameAnimations to makte them pausable and resumable ,1

5012,1558, The panorama mode is beautiful and if only we could have a button to call the API from inside our Apps it would be great ,1

5015,1582, Allow entering decimal values ,1
5016,1584, Format the text with a specific number of decimal place ie ,1

5018,1622, It should return DOM element and coordinates and in case of image also the raw bytes ,1
5019,1624, At least receiving ScriptNotify events should be possible on http and without adding ApplicationContentUriRules in Manifest so that we could atleast have a way to do it on our own ,1
5020,1629, Switch the default to LF style line endings in the whole operating system ,1
5021,1685, There are situations where you might want to interrupt navigating away from a page when using NavigationView ,1

5024,1801, In short we need a UWP alternative to ShowcaseView url ,1
5025,1808, There should be a Machine Learning SDK smilar to Apple CoreML ,1
5026,1809, UWP should include a Augmented reality SDK simlar to Apple ARKit and Google AR Dev Kit ,1
5027,1811, Could you add this to the list of UWP APIs supported in Desktop Bridge ,1
5028,1812, I really need to be able to programmatically restart my app ,1
5029,1819, Please fix it to support hiding PivotItems correctly especially during data binding when you can not simply add remove it from the Items collection ,1
5030,1860, Please make ESENT Jet Blue technology open source and available on NET Core and Xamarin for operating systems other than Windows ,1
5031,1865, New control to add multiples tags with close button and auto suggestion functionality ,1
5032,1870, Please add AllAccountsReadWrite to UserDataAccountStoreAccessType in order to allow to creates calendars on remote calendar providers ,1
5033,1873, Provide funtionality similar to CurrentAppSimulator class found in Windows ApplicationModel Store namespace ,1
5034,1876, Another solution could be simply extend Office Store in order to publish VSTO add in ,1
5035,1886, Please add reveal effect on each item on the listview in the hamburger menu control as per creators fall update ,1
5036,1887, The possibility to make optional packages plugins with code for in process with C # and or VB net instead of C ,1

5040,1900, You may wish to consider my FlipPdfViewerControl for inclusion in the toolkit ,1
5041,1907, It would be good to see support for setting a GridView inside a ListView which has the ability to add columns ,1
5042,1939, So your are not able to suggest a folder or file to the user by a path string ,1
5043,1946, What would be helpful is to have a service in the toolkit to get an azure ad token ,1
5044,1958, Having access to the Visibility of the System Back button is good but there are some scenario is where I think it would make sense to have a Disabled state for this button which could be toggled by Dev is in certain scenarios ,1
5045,1963, It would be nice to have a way to automate update upgrade Bash Ubuntu on Windows that does not require to start Bash ,1
5046,1965, You should update all the constants for the paper sizes for example constant for CR or business card and POS receipt paper wasn ' t stated but you wrote other sizes are being reserved ,1
5047,1968, Please allow generic classes to be base classes of XAML pages controls ,1
5048,1985, Obviously I would expect in point that neighboring files should still be available but maybe slightly slower ,1
5049,1996, Allow WinAppDriver to switch context from native to webview ,1
5050,2002, Imagine writing text directly into the TextBox or RichEditBox canvas without the Ink Keyboard Overlay ,1
5051,2007, By the way speech recognition should be handled the same way ,1
5052,2008, So come on all the APIs are already there emhappy Give Windows Ink a boost ,1
5053,2010, Would be a lot more intuitive useful and less distractive then the current overlay ,1
5054,2026, Please make sure the P Invoke either points to a Windows API allowed in UWP applications or a native DLL that is part of the package ,1
5055,2040, If for some reason your P Invoke does not satisfy those requirements please use DllImport ExactSpelling true to indicate that you understand the implications more ,1
5056,2041, Move from OneDrive SDK to Microsoft Graph ,1
5057,2042, Add MSAL support for v auth model ,1
5058,2045, Could this not also be provided in the UWP toolkit for inclusion in UWP apps ,1
5059,2046, Add a custom CalendarView control with more personalization options than the one included in the SDK ,1
5060,2056, Individual CalendarMonthView control so that if you want to display standalone months you can maybe you display a grid of months etc ,1
5061,2103, I think in first case must be fired ButtonPressed event too like it happens on phone call ,1
5062,2105, It would be very useful to be able to immediately release the memory held by a UWP BitmapImage which can be significant for large images ,1
5063,2112, Please make it possible to locate at the other three corners ,1
5064,2113, We need backward compatibility for XAML just like Android for example we can just use NavigationView without any conditional check at all ,1
5065,2115, Please add support for Composition Visual to handle pointer interactions ,1
5066,2120, It would be nice to have a UWP or Xamarin Community Tutorial where devs can contribute to the tutorial and make it up to date ,1
5067,2123, Create a Cordova plugin to enable IOS and Android hybrid apps to use Project Rome features ,1
5068,2137, I would really like to switch to UWP for development however I am not able to elevate users to install a UWP app that Win apps would not have any problem just downloading from a network drive ,1
5069,2176, And also in full screen I would expect transport controls to ignore safe area ,1
5070,2183, Could Microsoft not add a padding reflecting the core window bounds to the full screen window only instead of manipulating a grid by name ,1
5071,2196, I want the transport controls isemi transparent area more ,1
5072,2208, Add Tumblr Service Too ,1
5073,2210, We could also be able to start tracking packages directly too ,1
5074,2212, Consider a full screen application where you would like to temporarily control that brightness ,1
5075,2218, Please extend the API to run on desktop and mobile devices not in embedded mode ,1
5076,2250, It would be better if it was as fast as the WebClient class used in a desktop application ,1
5077,2260, Both problems could be solved by adding GroupStyle ItemTemplate ,1
5078,2262, And virtualization could be optimized as well by using container cache per group ,1
5079,2266, imagine a image viewer where you have one group Folders and one group Images ,1
5080,2267, Folders must of course use a very different item template than Images ,1
5081,2273, I want to see a better Windows Store first where my apps can be found ,1
5082,2279, Please give the highest priority to improve App Discoverability in Windows Store ,1
5083,2280, Apps must be found by keywords ,1
5084,2291, It would make sense that the app be published to the private store and users who have not been allocated a license should have the ability to request a license rather than just getting an error message ,1
5085,2318, For events the target method must not be overloaded ,1
5086,2323, Add a control that reminds users to rate your UWP app after a certain amount of time or app launches ,1
5087,2336, Depth tests are needed for fast skipping occluded pixels and depth reads in the shader are needed for calculating particle opacity to make them soft ,1
5088,2348, set depth writes enabled or disabled set other state changes make the draw call ,1
5089,2352, In my opinion the D D DSV READ ONLY DEPTH is really useless and should be removed any state validation for reading and writing to the depth texture should just check for D D DEPTH STENCIL DESC DepthWriteMask in each draw call ,1
5090,2353, However to do not sacrifice performance those validation checks should be performed only in debug mode D D SetExceptionMode D D RAISE FLAG DRIVER INTERNAL ERROR and in that case the draw call should still be allowed but it only should issue a debug warning writing to depth and reading from it in the shader may produce undefined results ,1
5091,2355, You should trust the application to let it manage the correct state changes on it is own without introducing artificial limitations and sacrificing performance ,1
5092,2360, This would result in smaller memory usage faster performance smaller cpu overhead power usage longer battery life ,1
5093,2364, You will do not have to do these checks if this artificial requirement is removed from emsad API ,1
5094,2374, Add ability to conditionally trigger a keyframe animation from an expression animation in order to support more complex animation scenarios ,1
5095,2386, Cam ' on we need a service status page with we have issue we are working on ,1
5096,2397, We already have the PullToRefreshListView in the toolkit so we can also integrate this functionality into the control and change the name to something more suitable like ListViewEx and have both of the functionality in a single control ,1
5097,2407, Please make the control usable in an app ,1
5098,2416, Make a menu with information about the files being locked by an application ,1
5099,2418, It would save a tons of space to only have one small SVG for a simple icon rather than a dozen large png files ,1
5100,2422, Add eyedropper ability to pick color outside of the UWP app ,1
5101,2424, There should be a form developers can fill out to request expedited review ,1
5102,2444, It would be useful if this limitation were removed allowing physical web support to be developed using windows alone without requiring additional hardware resources to publish beacons ,1
5103,2462, Can we please improve the situation by adding missing API ,1
5104,2467, For my work app we wanted the app to launch maximised ,1
5105,2468, The closet option is to launch it FullScreen but that obscures the task bar ,1
5106,2498, Allow app to launch URI with http schema in default video or audio player not only store player win apps support will be great ,1
5107,2509, What would be really helpful is to provide an event maybe something like DirectManipulationCompleting that would fire as soon as the pointer is released example ,1
5108,2525, Allow to register Background Tasks to be registered when die App is first installed from store or side loaded without having the need to start the app first ,1

5111,2536, In Japanese input the font style should be applied to the left character ,1
5112,2552, It would be great if the Slider control could have a TickOffset property to make the tick marks not start at the left most edge of the control ,1
5113,2556, It would be nice to be able to easily create rounded or circular buttons in UWP without creating custom control template ,1
5114,2579, Allow us to withdrawal the money because we do not know when we can reach the threshold USD ,1
5115,2583, This can be really helpful if you want to easily create a Multi Lingual Cortana Experience if you use RESW ,1
5116,2592, So we hope that UWP Image control and ImageSource can support more and more pixelformat like as WPF NET Framework ,1
5117,2599, Example Page App should be configured to use Dark theme ,1
5118,2602, To recreate paste the below XAML into a blank page and run be sure the app is configured to use Dark theme ,1
5119,2612, Accessing this information through an API would be useful for creating automated KPI reports ,1
5120,2617, As a Windows developer I would like the site to be improved to give a reasonable performance ,1
5121,2636, Create new user control with ability to selecte date and time something similar to url in WPFToolkit ,1

5123,2640, Would like to see the possibility to add a search bar to the master details view that filters results in the master pane ,1
5124,2652, Download GetPercentage to get the download compleated percentage so that it can be used for creating ProgessBar ,1
5125,2656, Should support Background Download ,1
5126,2658, Allow the WebView to display URI from the application is local folder ,1
5127,2704, Raise single events but it is bad for performance ,1
5128,2710, Raise reset event ,1
5129,2717, e NewItems but simple pick the first one ,1
5130,2731, So please allow UWP apps without NET Native ,1
5131,2733, I wish the InterstitialAd will have built in animation at least a fade in effect when it shows ,1
5132,2740, A better option would be to add a new ROLE option for the accounts to indicate which accounts can raise support issues ,1
5133,2744, It just needs the context command that returns the current context name which could be hard coded as NATIVE APP ,1
5134,2748, It would be nice if the driver returns correct size and position so that I do not have to guess and click through the tree to find an element ,1
5135,2754, User should be able to style the Carousel items like we do for ListViewItems ListBoxItems ,1
5136,2755, User should be able to write style for all the ViewState like Focused Selected UnSelected Normal etc ,1
5137,2756, We need a way to save documents generated and populated within our apps to PDF or XPS ,1
5138,2760, It would be nice if there were an option somewhere where you could reboot your system straight into the BIOS menu ,1

5142,2813, Could you add support of Xamarin Forms to the Project Rome SDK ,1
5143,2865, So please before you completely remove SuppressSystemOverlays make sure there is a way for us to force the status bar on and off even when we have entered full screen mode ,1
5144,2868, With SuppressSystemOverlays you can still force the status bar to show using StatusBar ShowAsync ,1
5145,2875, Please provide with more information or planschedule ,1
5146,2876, Release the SharedUserCertificates for individual developers ,1
5147,2877, trigger animation based on scroll position or percentage while we scroll pan in UWP C # like many web ui component as superscrollrama js ,1
5148,2879, Since something like this would pretty much be aligned with the whole motion theme of the Fluent Design System I think it would be great if you could support it in future builds so we could use it with other Composition APIs to add new visual details and effects to our apps that are not possible at the moment ,1
5149,2882, bring RIP Silverlight deepzoom control to UWP control and pivotviewer too with win D capabilities ,1
5150,2883, My suggestion idea is to reduce the development time effort needed for ASP NET web application ,1
5151,2886, Typical problem here would be deployment Installationupdate of the UI application to client machine But if we simplify this process of deployment like having the rules that the UI app should be only one obfuscated executable file It should not depend on reference libraries ,1
5152,2889, This UI should get loaded on client machine as the user types in url in windows task bar which has the search boxthus removing the dependency on browser for web applications ,1
5153,2890, The downloaded application should not be taking much space on user machine and it should not require installation and it should not require user to double click open but it should open as the user types the url in the search box in task bar ,1
5154,2891, This UI application should have pure UI logic with all xaml files instead of html to support running on all devices and all OS linuxwindows onwards ,1
5155,1, It seems StorageFolder CreateFolder does not support multi segment path ,0
5156,4, Windows System RemoteSystems RemoteSystem does not provide meaningful data for Xbox ,0
5157,6, And checking GetCapabilitySupportedAsync is always false for any known capability ,0
5158,7, When adding a StatusFilter for Available Xbox is never shown ,0
5159,8, This makes it very hard to know upfront if the user can actually launch an URI on Xbox because it is totally unclear whether Xbox is currently running or applications are allowed to run remotely ,0
5160,9, Nevertheless if Xbox is running and I use the RemoteLauncher the app is at least started correctly ,0
5161,12, The state is always Unknown when the watcher triggers Added or Updated event ,0

5163,21, From the build Windows ApplicationModel AppService AppServiceConnection OpenAsync consistently returns ' Unknown Error ' ,0
5164,22, I have tried this sample but not a luck ,0
5165,23, The unknown error also happens on build and I am curious is this just a bug or will this feature stop on future windows release ,0

5167,27, Microsoft support working for Report App are taking down apps which have partial but no nudity ,0
5168,29, Game of Thrones is on the Windows Store and contains full frontal nudity and graphic scenes so it is quite ridiculous when apps are removed that have partial nudity or body parts blurred out or covered ,0
5169,32, Windows Store Policy for Adult Content ,0
5170,36, Partial nudity is not pornographic nor sexually explicit ,0
5171,44, Note that a Windows Forms implementation probably will not work because of deep seated incompatibilities in the Windows Forms architecture ,0
5172,45, A WPF only solution is enough for me however ,0
5173,46, It is currently officially impossible to display the acrylic window background effect in a non UWP window ,0
5174,47, Several developers have managed to coax out the private API used to implement this feature in a desktop app see url however this API is officially unsupported can change at any time and has been changed in a backwards incompatible manner once in the past ,0
5175,50, With the new Windows UI Library now in pre release ,0
5176,51, Are there plans to ensure new controls will be listed in the Toolbox alongside the OS based standard controls ,0
5177,52, Will dragging from the toolbox automatically add the using markup to the page ,0
5178,53, Will the Blend features like isolated Template editing be working ,0
5179,55, Consistency could be ruined if every dev needs to handle manual markup especially as the UI Toolkit iterates in the future ,0
5180,60, Will the compact mode resource dictionary be bundled with the nuget package so it can be referenced in the app resources without having to ask developers to copy and paste XAML files ,0
5181,66, Currently the ManipulationDelta event args provides a single scale factor for pinch stretch events ,0

5192,101, I have a bar code scanner attached to my windows machine USB port ,0
5193,104, Probably through a direct draw surface s ,0
5194,106, Without this information it will not be worthwhile for me to pursue the creation of a virtual reality system and with this information I can get the job done in a few days ,0

5205,134, At Build support between Cortana and Alexa was announced ,0
5206,137, I have built an app that targets Windows and the customer is looking for a servicing fix on Windows ,0
5207,138, I have got the fix ready but in order to produce a fix I need to be able to compile with the Microsoft Advertising SDK for Windows Xaml ,0
5208,139, Is there anywhere I can find a copy and download it ,0
5209,142, I have included code to reproduce the issue ,0

5212,147, Call stack url ,0

5217,157, How many consumers runs W on their computers or laptops ,0
5218,168, The ApplicationViewMode CompactOverlay also known as Picture in Picture Mini Mode or Always on top for UWP apps has a maximum window size which seems to be a square with sides of approximately half screen height ,0
5219,170, Unfortunately I can not since this is limited through Windows ,0
5220,171, Is there a good reason for this somehow arbitrary limit ,0
5221,176, It is mini mode has exactly the same limitation ,0
5222,181, Other than our product manager said pixels are a good maximum width and height for something called compact ,0
5223,187, Previously it was possible to add an EventSetter to the DataGridRows istyle As mentioned here url but since EventSetter is now not apart of UWP I am left without this functionality ,0
5224,190, This already exists with the ListView class which has a similar ItemClicked event as an alternative to SelectionChanged ,0
5225,192, This can become inefficient and somewhat confusing when users are able to select more than one items ,0
5226,197, This is helpful for layout debugging ,0
5227,199, Suppose Windows is misbehaving ,0
5228,201, Suppose I want this to happen under program control ,0
5229,204, Suppose I want it to be absolutely certain the video has not been monkeyed with ,0

5235,213, What would I do ,0
5236,215, It looks like the bridge cannot remove it is own folder while cleaning up the environment ,0
5237,217, I made a UWP app with a ListView using KeepLastItemInView ,0
5238,218, On many systems probably the slower ones the scrolling behavior is very odd ,0
5239,219, Using the touchpad mousewheel the scrollbar starts moving but not the contents of the ListView ,0
5240,221, I need to drag the scrollbar using the mouse to go the bottom top of the ListView ,0
5241,222, This behavior is not consistent ,0
5242,223, On other systems is works as expected ,0

5343,460, for side loading you need to install the cer file contained in the AppPackages AppName version censored Test folder to your system cert store unter trusted roots OK Something must be wrong with the uploaded appxupload package ,0
5344,463, This package does always crash after side loading it ,0

5357,483, But why was it working on my local machine ,0
5358,484, This is because I am using Visual Studio which has already fixed the problem ,0
5359,485, Unfortunately the build infrastructure of Microsoft which is used for the UWP certification process at least for our targeted OS version Windows falls creators update uses the buggy version of the SupportedAPIs x ,0
5360,487, After I used the latest version of PInvoke Kernel dll which contains a workaround for the problem all was fine ,0

5516,961, In order to download the Windows Driver Kit I must first install Visual Studio ,0
5517,962, I am not going to download multiple GBs of that I will never use to fix a memory leak ,0
5518,963, That just turns my memory leak issue into a hard drive bloat issue ,0
5519,965, Thanks for nothing Microsoft ,0
5520,968, Poolmon is not offered as a standalone tool and only as part of the Windows Driver Kit so I must download the entire Windows Driver Kit to access this one small tool ,0

5544,1046, In release mode we generate the appx and it passes windows certification ,0
5545,1047, The smartcard functionality however which is based on a net standard library fails to work url ,0
5546,1048, We are now trying to use the native UWP SmartCard API but it is largely useless as we cannot find any methods to construct and transmit APDyou which are the basic communication block ,0
5547,1049, Hope this issue lands in the priority list of Microsoft ,0
5548,1050, For now we have no option but to re build the app to a non Microsoft environment ,0

5569,1116, Both Process Isolation and Hyper V Isolation for Containers are available in Windows Server but Windows only supports Hyper V isolation ,0
5570,1117, Hyper V isolation has benefits but also has many drawbacks such as resource allocation performance as well as stability ,0

5582,1145, The first time the app is opened it downloads news article and display is say the top to user in a ListView and rest are stored locally ,0
5583,1146, These are displayed if the user scrolls down Incremental Loading Collection Helpers are great addition ,0
5584,1147, Now let us say next day the app is opened again ,0
5585,1149, As soon as new stories are downloaded they are added at the from of the ListView not all but say top and rest goes to the disk cache ,0

5593,1185, Packaged COM url allows exposing out of proc COM objects using desktop bridge however these COM objects are not accessible from UWP apps even if the UWP apps are packaged into same desktop bridge exposes the COM objects ,0
5594,1191, It is understandable that when UWP app is run normally it can only access a limited set of COM objects however if the UWP is packaged to desktop bridge it makes sense to allow it to access additional COM objects exposed by that desktop bridge using the technical described in the blog above ,0
5595,1194, We are a dev house that specialises in publishing dedicated Xbox Apps ,0
5596,1195, It used to be that there was a really high standard to get certified on Xbox which was tough to get through but at least the standard of apps was pretty high ,0
5597,1196, Now it seems there is zero standard to be certified to publish an app on Xbox and by default EVERY windows app that is published is published on all devices ,0
5598,1199, It is totally crazy and really counterproductive to building any kind of a vibrant ecosystem ,0
5599,1200, One simple example is there is a PDF database app on the new apps list on XBOX ,0
5600,1201, You cannot use it it cannot access files and it has absolutely no viable function on Xbox One ,0
5601,1202, Yet somehow this passes certification and is thrown on the pile of rubbish that now clutters the new app section ,0
5602,1204, It is hugely frustrating to put months of work into building an app for xbox and stand no chance of getting it downloaded because nobody will ever be able to find it ,0

5609,1224, These are the APIs that ought to be allowed in UWP when codeGeneration is permitted ,0
5610,1227, On UWP for x ARM and ARM it is not possible to comply with the Windows ABI when generating code at runtime because you cannot generate the mandatory exception table data for the dynamically generated code ,0
5611,1235, Otherwise this function is useful to runtime code generation ,0

5615,1248, But there is no numerical value representing the amount of data that will have to be downloaded ,0
5616,1249, Please fix this annoying issue ,0
5617,1252, UWP is too safe so as to be impractical for so many desktop apps and WPF is like a third class citizen with Microsoft in the background cheering Upgrade to UWP ,0

5632,1301, Run the code again ,0
5633,1304, The test log file is created again ,0
5634,1307, It should have been time or later ,0
5635,1308, Run this as many times as you like the create date will not change from the first time you ran the code ,0
5636,1313, How to reproduce ,0
5637,1319, It deletes the file ,0
5638,1325, Having SOCK SEQPACKET would remove the burden of distinguishing between independent messages from the user ,0
5639,1329, Some users certainly will find this useful ,0
5640,1331, Sadly if you are someone who finds this annoying there is no option to disable this behavior ,0
5641,1332, According to the singular post I was able to find on this new feature url there is no way to disable this ,0
5642,1341, It currently only supports octet stream ,0
5643,1348, Actually we can not because the same notification would be send too if the user is closing the application ,0
5644,1352, This issue was reported for Visual Studio Feedback Site but They have determined that this issue belongs to universal windows platform ,0

5660,1391, These are some of the most common scenarios which are required by developers and there are many ways to do it but this can get very complicated to align them with best practices ,0
5661,1397, this search bar auto filters the items on basis of the filterDescriptor provided filter descriptor can be defined by the developer tht which stringtimeint property to match with which condition i e Contains startswith endswith e t c ,0
5662,1402, We also use multiple top level windows that are already available ,0

5664,1407, The app gets rejected during submission to the store as some features are disabled as admin privileges are required ,0
5665,1411, So in a round about way you are actually raising the chances of users getting viruses by blocking these apps as they just get them from the web instead ,0
5666,1428, Current clipboard API can notify about a clipboard content change which is fine ,0
5667,1429, But getting or setting the content does not work if the app is in background or unfocused ,0

5673,1450, x Bind is great and I love it ,0
5674,1454, This limit is not in the EmailMessage url documentation ,0
5675,1456, This limit appears to be arbitrary and not on par with other platforms iOS Android Mac OSX ,0
5676,1457, This limitation is a contribution to a diminished user experience and developer experience when compared to these other platforms ,0
5677,1459, This idea is so bad on so many levels ,0
5678,1460, So what is the suggestion ,0
5679,1463, As a Xamarin Forms developer I had to drill down frameworks to find this limitation ,0
5680,1466, Especially if that steam roller is riddled with security issues and complexity way beyond the experience and latitude of most fly swatter users ,0
5681,1467, In this url following forum post the character limit for an email body generated via code from an app is noted ,0
5682,1476, ContentDialog is currently far too difficult to use for two reasons locking and placement ,0
5683,1482, This means that ContentDialog ShowAsync will wait until any currently displayed ContentDialog is dismissed before showing the new dialog ,0
5684,1487, On the other hand if ShowAsync ContentDialogPlacement InPlace is used then a it is not convenient because one must separately embed the dialog in XAML and b it does not always work because an exception occurs if ShowAsync InPlace is called on the dialog before the XAML is fully loaded ,0

5693,1521, Ive also tried Bindings Update bit this does not help either ,0
5694,1524, If you are using x Bind to bind that control is value to a property in the ContentDialog code behind page then when you press the primary button the property does not get updated ,0

5775,1829, At high zoom levels above percent the entire UWP app will crash with a native exception An unhandled win exception occured in app ,0
5776,1832, This crash only happens using the Fall Creators Update after the clipping issue was fixed ,0
5777,1833, I am guessing it is a numerical overflow somewhere deep in the graphics stack ,0
5778,1835, This chart supports zooming and the PathFigure size is changed during zoom but clipped within the visible Chart area ,0
5779,1838, There must be a bug some place in the framework ,0
5780,1839, This crash only happens using the Fall Creators Update after the clipping more ,0
5781,1840, The following Hyper V networking Configuration breaks DNS name resolution on the Virtual Machine ,0
5782,1842, Connecting the host to a non corporate remote WiFi network ,0
5783,1847, When a VM is connected to the default switch and the host is connected to the corporate network via Cisco AnyConnect the VM looses the ability to resolve DNS addresses ,0
5784,1848, The VM is able to ping both public addresses and corporate addresses however it is unable to resolve names on either the public internet or corporate network ,0
5785,1849, This issue was submitted as a MS Premier support ticket url and a Connect bug url ,0
5786,1850, Was advised by Premier that this is an architectural issue ,0
5787,1859, The VM is able to ping both public addresses and corporate addresses however it is unable to resolve names on either the public more ,0
5788,1867, In stack overflow or any other forums we have option to add multiple tags related to our question ,0
5789,1868, Currently is not possibile to create a new Calendar inside an Enterprise Exchange user account ,0
5790,1869, It is only allowed to create an app calendar which lives on local device ,0
5791,1874, At the moment a VSTO add in cannot be published on Windows Store or on Office Store ,0
5792,1875, An idea could be extending Desktop App Converter tool in order to manage VSTO add in ,0
5793,1877, I reported that since studio the designer crash due to attached properties ,0
5794,1893, However when using the result in a Drag Drop or Clipboard operation Windows Explorer errors out with x No such interface supported ,0
5795,1894, It can be used between UWP apps but not in Windows Explorer which really is a shame ,0
5796,1895, There are desktop Win APIs for delay creation of files that are used heavily example ,0
5797,1896, in WinZIP and similar applications to delay actual unzip of files until really required but they cannot be used in UWP ,0
5798,1899, Things like MinConnectionInterval MaxConnectionInterval SlaveLatency and Connection Supervisory Timeout ,0
5799,1901, It is a compendium of various PDF viewer tutorials rolled into a single user control ,0
5800,1908, This of course can already be found in WPF any for any developers who want to migrate their classic desktop app to UWP this would be a big boost ,0
5801,1922, So at the moment i have to tell my customers open the folder picker and navigate from the pictures library to the path emlaugh emannoyed very long path final folder ,0
5802,1925, actual implementing an selection of file or folder in UWP how easy but stupid ,0
5803,1932, so picker SuggestedStartLocation is not a string to a path but only a selection of libraries ,0
5804,1934, now after the great Windows Fall Creators Update it is still a joke to switch and develop to UWP ,0
5805,1936, does anybody at MS have an idea how to propose an path in an UWP application ,0
5806,1937, Under UWP it is still not possible to open a folder or file out of the sandbox ,0
5807,1941, and thereby the folderpicker has no preview to the content in a folder ,0
5808,1942, so this is now in after the great fall creators update still a ridiculous status of the great iniative change to more ,0
5809,1943, We will currently I have a Uwp app that needs to call a web api service that is secured with azure ad ,0
5810,1944, I have been looking for samples and tutorials to do this and I have found some ,0
5811,1945, But they all differ in what to do exactly ,0
5812,1959, For example a long running task where the user is not allowed to back out until it completes ,0
5813,1966, Am even stock now I would be glad if you can update it now ,0
5814,1971, I need a similar feature for UWP ,0
5815,1972, There are several issues with the file activation NeighboringFilesQuery argument and the file system indexer ,0
5816,1974, If files are loaded using the NeighboringFilesQuery then GetPropertiesAsync on those files will only return properties that have been indexed ,0
5817,1975, This prevents reading things like altitude from the GPS location data ,0
5818,1977, The above is made a lot worse on computers where indexing file content is disabled right click on the drive in Explorer select properties and see check box at the bottom which used to be recommended for SSD drives ,0
5819,1978, In particular no ImageProperties are available in this case ,0
5820,1981, If the indexer is really broken for some reason this started happening on my computer so is not uncommon then it will fail to pick up any neighboring files at all confirmed by using the default Photos app to open a photo in a folder with lots of photos and it only showed one photo ,0
5821,1984, I do not think this is a security issue because the data is in the file and the file contents are readable ,0
5822,1998, When setting ToolTipService Placement to Mouse the text in the tooltip is no longer sharp ,0
5823,1999, It looks like the tooltip is not perfectly aligned to the device pixels but rather half a pixel off vertically ,0
5824,2000, This is on Windows Fall Creators Update build @ percent DPI scale the app targets Windows SDK ,0
5825,2011, Example Open the Mail App write the mail content with the pen directly on the RichEditBox canvas text gets recognised Boom done ,0
5826,2013, The way ink Input is currently handled is sooo Win emwink I know there is InkCanvas and Windows UI Input Inking Analysis put this should be build into the text controls in a standard more ,0
5827,2014, Currently In MasterView we can only use ListView ,0
5828,2015, It limits the use case of MasterView ,0
5829,2016, We can not use Pivot Semantic Zoom GridView PullToRefresh SlidableListItem and more ,0
5830,2019, Then devs can use Connected Animations ,0
5831,2020, I upgraded to the latest VS and change my UWP app to use Net Native ,0
5832,2021, It now gets a number of linker problems that are being caused by Microsoft components ,0
5833,2029, I do not call this function ,0
5834,2030, When I traced down some new crashes I found that Socket ConnectAsync is trying to call this function and failing because it does not exist ,0
5835,2031, I have about similar errors in the build that are referencing things I do not directly call ,0
5836,2032, I have reverted to Net Native until this gets fixed ,0
5837,2038, Calling this method would throw exception at runtime ,0
5838,2044, In Windows Forms toolkit there is a handy control called the NumericUpDownControl ,0
5839,2049, CalendarView control that consumes the CalendarMonthView ,0
5840,2051, CalendarView supports arrows that appear when hovered allowing mouse users to switch months ,0
5841,2052, CalendarView supports mouse scroll to switch months ,0
5842,2062, Current appextension only supports loading assets and scripts ,0
5843,2064, There may be trusting problems ,0
5844,2066, Repro project url ,0
5845,2067, We are experiencing an issue where the presence of a PasswordBox with a NumericPin InputScope overrides the InputScope of other controls on the page until the PasswordBox has received focus ,0
5846,2068, On a touch screen this manifests every time a user reaches the first page in our UWP App that has a NumericPin scoped PasswordBox ,0
5847,2072, Build and run the app ,0
5848,2078, Keyboard remains NumericPin ,0
5849,2080, See that the InputScopes of the TextBoxes are now honored ,0
5850,2096, Before doing anything else click the Show touch keyboard button in the notification tray such that the touch keyboard appears ,0
5851,2098, I think I found a problem in Media Player ,0
5852,2100, In this case will be fired only MediaPlayer PlaybackSession PlaybackStateChanged event and it is not possible to detect whether app was paused through user or system ,0
5853,2101, But if phone calls then will be simulated SystemMediaTransportControls pause button click MediaPlayer SystemMediaTransportControls ButtonPressed event and on phone call I can correctly stop my player and change some states ,0
5854,2107, I have looked into using a SoftwareBitmapSource instead but this is a lot slower and uses more memory and I am not percent sure whether it is Dispose method works does not affect memory shown in VS debugger but did seem to have an effect when testing using a mobile emulator ,0
5855,2109, I am preloading images for speed and I need to release the memory immediately when no longer needed to prevent memory failures but setting the reference to null and even calling GC Collect immediately does not always result in an immediate release of memory ,0
5856,2111, Compact overlay window is always shown at the right top corner ,0
5857,2116, This would help in hit testing of Visuals ,0
5858,2117, More details can be found in this issue ,0
5859,2119, We can see the support of communities in UWcomputerommunityToolkit ,0
5860,2121, As a self learner it is very hard to find a tutorial to learn new things ,0
5861,2124, I hear a lot about clean uninstall but we noticed a few months ago appx leaves some stuff behind ,0
5862,2125, Specifically persisted appframe window sizing data remains behind potentially leaving the user dev in a potential bad or confusing window state ,0
5863,2126, See the data piling up in the following stores ,0
5864,2130, A lot of small time developers like myself do not have the means to use the Microsoft Store to host their apps ,0
5865,2131, I develop applications for the military and the IT department barely has any idea what they are doing ,0
5866,2133, Win apps still dominate because they are so robust and developed ,0
5867,2139, To bring in new and old developers bring back the same functionality that is found in WPF more ,0
5868,2153, and not calling SetDesiredBounds ,0
5869,2154, This is what the screen looks like url ,0
5870,2155, sorry for the photo could not do a regular screen shot at the moment ,0
5871,2157, Yes video and transport controls cover the entire media player ,0
5872,2159, In full screen transport controls not video do also respect the safe area ,0
5873,2164, Otherwise this looks cut and incomplete ,0
5874,2165, Nevertheless so far this is ok and could be called as expected ,0
5875,2169, The safe area is removed and it looks like the following url ,0
5876,2171, Page has no more safe area BUT on the transport controls have suddenly the safe area even though the media player is part WITHIN the page ,0
5877,2172, For full screen it remains the same framed version as before so no additional screen shot Why are transport controls no longer covering the entire video ,0
5878,2174, That is an real issue ,0
5879,2175, I am removing the safe area by calling SetDesiredBounds and I am experiencing framed transport controls then even when using as control somewhere within the page ,0
5880,2177, I debugged this a lot and found a solution and realized a very dirty hack by Microsoft ,0
5881,2178, In my app I am using custom transport controls and I used the original template as a starting point ,0
5882,2180, This is documented nowhere and has the bad effect described above ,0
5883,2182, Nevertheless I would expect a less hacky solution ,0
5884,2185, And fiddling arround with a grid by name is just a dirty hack since this does not work with custom transport controls as long as the magic grid with it is name is not present ,0
5885,2198, But when we play a video file using MediaStreamSource it is not possible to pass through the subtitle streams because we cannot create MediaStreamDescriptors for them ,0
5886,2199, So audio and video works but subtitles do not work ,0
5887,2202, I am unable to use containers and VmWare VirtualBox on Windows at the same time due to the restriction of Hyper V ,0
5888,2203, This restriction does not exist on Linux and MacOS ,0
5889,2207, It does not seem to quite have an equivalent in UWP in order to get even spacing of a grid automatically as well as other features like setting rows columns and first column for calendar type applications ,0
5890,2223, A previous uservoice API to control screen brightness url was marked closed after Creators update with Brightness control being introduced ,0
5891,2224, BrightnessOverride would fit the purpose except it requires IoT Embedded mode and therefore cannot use this API ,0
5892,2226, Apple announced support for Fragmented MP backed HLS Streams under HLS version url at WWDC ,0
5893,2227, We are looking to change the way our HLS streams are generated and Windows seems to be one of the few platforms that does not support playing these type of streams ,0
5894,2230, if the DataTemplate x DataType models LocalStatus references POCO class that is in a seperate project the XAML will not compile ,0
5895,2232, I submitted this to the VS forum but they said to post the issue here ,0
5896,2239, We now have this option for ListView and GridView but not for the ComboBox control ,0
5897,2241, The StreamSocket class has no good way of polling the connection status without sending data your connection may have died minutes ago but you will not know until you try to send something which is not desirable ,0
5898,2243, The proposal is to add something like ,0
5899,2246, Something happened update your UI or run your business logic ,0
5900,2248, While downloading a file with BackgroundDownloader the progress updates every MB which is not really accurate ,0
5901,2249, I have noticed that pausing and resuming the download accelerates the update rate to about every ms ,0
5902,2252, There are many cases where you have different kind of data and group them by data type ,0
5903,2256, Or you display search results for various item types in one view ,0
5904,2258, But it causes a context switch from native net and back for each item which will slow down the control when showing a lot of items this is noticeable on slow devices or phones ,0
5905,2261, Now the control does not need to call selector for every item speeding up the control ,0
5906,2270, But it causes a context switch from native net and back for each item which more ,0
5907,2272, Desktop Bridge attracts me as a developer but Windows Store puts me off ,0
5908,2275, There are no keyword searches ,0
5909,2277, This has been like that for many years but no one has done anything about it ,0
5910,2281, There are many threads on Internet discussing this issue but Windows Store team does not seem to listen ,0
5911,2286, Currently the only way to find programs are if you type their names ,0
5912,2289, This has been like that for many years but no more ,0
5913,2292, Otherwise the private store can only be used for in house apps or free apps ,0
5914,2300, This crash occurs in all JavaScript apps that use the MediaCapture API to display camera Video previews ,0
5915,2301, For this reason apps programmed in JavaScript that use Video or photo capturing are from now on non functional in Windows ,0
5916,2302, According to the documentation it is possible to x Bind events to a handler ,0
5917,2309, So for the CalendarView SelectedDatesChanged event the following signature works ,0
5918,2314, This behavior is not found in public documentation ,0
5919,2319, When working with parameters this works as long as the parameters have the default names ,0
5920,2326, As per url the Dev center has support to monitor Crash reports for native win desktop apps without publishing into the store ,0
5921,2327, But I could not find any option in my dev center account to support this functionality ,0
5922,2329, However the API was designed that it will introduce severe overhead in the following scenario ,0
5923,2331, These objects are semi transparent alpha blending so I need to draw them sorted by distance to camera back to front and not by state changes ,0
5924,2332, Let us assume I have objects which are Soft Particles SP ,0
5925,2333, And objects that are triangle meshes TM ,0
5926,2334, Both SP and TM use alpha blending ,0
5927,2335, SP do not do depth writes but they do depth tests and depth reads in the shader ,0
5928,2339, So both SP and TM do legal operations they do not write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time ,0
5929,2340, However in the worst case when SP and TM are ordered in the following way ,0
5930,2350, To my understanding OMSetRenderTargets is a slow operation but I need to call it times ,0
5931,2356, That way would be very beneficial ,0
5932,2358, I do not need to call OMSetRenderTargets for each draw call where I want to change D D DSV READ ONLY DEPTH ,0
5933,2368, Say I have objects to draw ,0
5934,2373, SP do not do depth writes but they do depth tests more ,0
5935,2375, See GitHub issue for more information and scenarios url ,0
5936,2377, it is extremely annoying when I face service issues with devcenter with no knowledge if they are investigated or not ,0
5937,2378, I do not want all the time contact support wait wait wait and yeah we have issues or now is just Saturday I have to wait til Monday ,0
5938,2379, With service issue I mean devcenter backend is down or does not work properly in some ways ,0
5939,2381, At least we are not totally in the dark in a limbo where we do not know if the issue is just a transient one or a serious one and we have to way days ,0

5942,2394, Some devices apps do not have the ability of input pairing password ,0
5943,2396, There is already an example we can reuse in UWP samples url ,0
5944,2406, The WebView control does not allow printing embedded PDFs etc ,0
5945,2408, If it works in Edge Chrome and Firefox it should work in WebView control ,0
5946,2411, Since Edge does not support lockdown usage like IE did with Kiosk mode it makes it even more important to have this ,0
5947,2412, I add a CustomAudioEffect which is EQ I have also tried using official UWP sample is EchoEffect to MediaPlayer ,0
5948,2413, Although it seems CustomAudioEffect is running on Worker thread not UI thread it seems media playback would also be impact when UI loading a bit heavier ,0
5949,2414, I could hear my music become intermittently ,0
5950,2420, So often the png splash screen is larger than all of the app is compiled code ,0
5951,2421, I would also be OK using a Xaml Path ,0
5952,2425, Apple has such a form and on the few occasions that I have needed to use it they have generally completed a review in a few hours ,0
5953,2427, I found a similar suggestion made back in which was closed when the certification expectation time was lowered to three days ,0
5954,2433, Three days is not fast enough for more ,0

5959,2440, I have two identical USB Zebra printers and cannot tell them apart ,0
5960,2441, Something like Requesting Reviews on iOS SKStoreReviewController ,0
5961,2442, The current support for Bluetooth LE in Win Creators Update does not allow publishing of an Eddystone beacon url because the api reserves the use of many data section types ,0
5962,2443, This limits the capability of the btle publishing api to manufacturer specific payloads ,0
5963,2449, This meant that I ended up using PreferredLaunchViewSize during first launch and then Auto on subsequent launches ,0
5964,2450, This is what I am currently using ,0

5981,2517, When you use x Bind to bind a TextBox to a property of the SelectedItem of a ListView this problem exists ,0
5982,2521, Your changes from are lost because the selection in the ListView changes before the LostFocus event of the TextBox was raised ,0
5983,2522, That means the change was never written back to the original item ,0
5984,2523, This bug more description and the code to reproduce it can be found in this blogpost ,0
5985,2526, The UpdateTask or PreConfigurationTask capabilities are good examples ,0

5989,2544, If it is not intended why then is it not called Windows CRT for Microsoft VC what am I missing and is it really legal appropriate ,0
5990,2546, Apparently even the simplest C program will not be able to compile as soon as you include any standard C header because they all seem to end up attempting to hashtag include vcruntime h which is not part of the UCRT ,0
5991,2551, If it is not intended why then is more ,0
5992,2558, The ComboBox now automatically has the infinite scrolling behavior when lots of items are present ,0
5993,2559, This is confusing for users as they are seeing the same items multiple times ,0
5994,2560, The ComboBox uses the CarouselPanel but this does not have the option to disable circular scrolling either ,0
5995,2561, My app contains a CalendarView component ,0
5996,2563, The user looks at the CalendarView the today highlight does not update and therefore shows yesterday is date as today ,0
5997,2582, It was inspired by NotificationExtensions where you can create the Cortana VCD xml using C # instead of figuring out how to define the XML yourself ,0
5998,2584, As well as a RESW File Code Generator Or RESX and a tool like the MultiLingual Toolkit ,0

6014,2613, The site Windows Dev Center url is very slow when navigating with Edge ,0
6015,2614, We are talking page load times of several minutes in many cases ,0
6016,2616, The site is faster in Chrome and IE but still not fast and gives a poor user experience due to the lack of performance ,0
6017,2624, Currently it is at risk of giving the impression of being neglected more ,0
6018,2626, I have an implementation that I am more than happy to provide ,0
6019,2627, I saw that ImageEx is fade animation does not allow developers to change duration and fixed to one second ,0

6024,2638, It is just few lines of code but useful since content with some header is present everywhere in the UI ,0
6025,2641, Functionality similar to people app ,0
6026,2642, Downloading from the web is a very common thing to do in Apps but it does not have any dedicated control for it ,0
6027,2659, Currently I developinng an application based on Xamarin Forms and it is not possible on UWP to access files in the local folder ,0
6028,2660, On Android this is no problem ,0
6029,2668, I am looking to use ECDH key agreement in an universal windows app but I can not find a way to do so ,0
6030,2669, Note that this is not ECDSA the use of elliptic curve keys in a signature mode ,0
6031,2670, I have previously used the desktop NCryptCreatePersistedKey with NCRYPT ECDH P ALGORITHM followed by ,0
6032,2672, Which situation am I in ,0
6033,2673, I missed the documentation that explained how to do this ,0
6034,2676, I would have expected that this would be the way to start but there is no ECDH possible in url ,0
6035,2690, We have implemented a FastObservableCollection see url ,0
6036,2693, Before recent changes we were ab using the Reset event type to inform the UI components that the collection has changed ,0
6037,2694, In the current version we have optimized the collection so it knows exactly what has changed in the suspension state ,0
6038,2695, We will only invoke the correct Add Remove actions for all the items ,0
6039,2696, Unfortunately it looks like the UI components in this case a ListBox cannot deal with the Add and multiple items ,0
6040,2701, The event args implementation correctly contains all the added items and the right indexes all covered by unit tests ,0
6041,2714, For some notes on the investigation see url ,0
6042,2715, I think this is a bug in the way the UI components deal with the NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs instance ,0
6043,2718, I do not see this limitation documentated anywhere but I might have missed it ,0
6044,2727, We will only invoke the correct Add Remove actions more ,0
6045,2728, In NET Native is still not mature and still has bugs ,0
6046,2730, Interestingly Apps wrapped with Desktop Bridge do not have to use NET Native ,0
6047,2737, When using a company Store account with associated developer accounts it is presently not possible for the developers to raise support issues for Store problems ,0
6048,2739, This is a real problem where we have multiple teams that are shipping apps and we need to share the ' master ' account name and password with lots of people thus removing any value of using AD federation ,0
6049,2742, I understand WinAppDriver does not currently support WebView and therefore it does not support context switching so context command is not provided ,0
6050,2745, Then Appium will happily use the native locator ,0
6051,2746, I can get the page source with current WinAppDriver and I see all the elements returned have the attributes for size width height or position x y but the values of those attribute are all zero ,0
6052,2758, With SSDs and faster processors boot up is often times only a second sometimes less ,0
6053,2759, It has become difficult to both know what key you need to press and get the timing of the press correct to be able to access your BIOS ,0
6054,2761, i am using Windows and VS I have a Finguerprint sensor and Windows hello installed and working fine ,0
6055,2766, The problem I found is that it currently shows a UI dialog asking for current loged in user credentials confirmation ,0
6056,2767, It was suppose to show afther this the Windows Hello Settings page for finguerprint detection as is in the normal Windows Windows Hello Settings page ,0
6057,2768, Afther loged in user confirmation the dialog closes and no forther finguerprint detection is possible ,0
6058,2769, I dont know is this is a Security norm from Microsoft to not allow outside settings finguer detection ,0
6059,2773, thank you Jose Lopes ,0
6060,2775, It detects finguers ,0
6061,2776, i am now developing a UWP app for multiuser registration using finguerprint ,0
6062,2781, Afther loged in user confirmation the dialog more ,0
6063,2784, Each number represents the shadow in each side ,0
6064,2788, In percent of cases I receive MeasureOverride exception or Error HRESULT E FAIL has been returned from a call to a COM component No matter what the problem is you will get that kind of useless information ,0
6065,2789, Which means that something went wrong ,0
6066,2790, No stacktrace and guess yourself is what WinRT development looks like ,0
6067,2794, Initially if I have rtf text in first line and then after adding bullets to the same line the bullets does not appears in same color font and font family ,0
6068,2795, If the device is connected to a network speech recognition with local SRGS custom grammar it behaves exactly as if it did not have the local grammar and starts to communicate to the websockets platform bing com endpoint increasing by tens of times the waiting time for the result ,0
6069,2796, But if the device is disconnected from any network then the waiting time between SpeechRecognizer StateChanged starts SoundEnded and the ResultGenerated event is invoked is very small less than ms ,0
6070,2798, Even the official Microsoft UWP sample accuses the same problem ,0
6071,2801, For large teams just having one team member being able to do this is a bad design decision ,0
6072,2802, The API is fine but where I am running into trouble is that things like Flyouts and Dialogs intercept any and all access to the event ,0
6073,2803, Event registration order does not seem to make a difference ,0
6074,2804, This makes for problems with things like ,0
6075,2806, Cached SplitView with IsPaneOpen True inside a Frame that is navigated forward ,0
6076,2807, The SplitView captures the first BackRequested rather than the page navigation ,0
6077,2811, I am a developer trying to make a Discord app for Windows Phone Windows Tablet Xbox and HoloLens ,0
6078,2818, Only Horizontal Scrolling available because it is one row only ,0
6079,2822, When the user will press button for next items then items will scroll and next set of items will appear on the screen ,0
6080,2824, Example Best example is the youtube homepage has this control where suggested videos from different channels are shown in single row ,0
6081,2833, When the user will press button for next items then items will scroll and next set of items will appear on the more ,0
6082,2836, I have not found any possible way to do that so I assume it does not exist currently ,0
6083,2838, The SerialDevice implementation appears to be very unstable in general but doubly so when compiling as Native ,0
6084,2839, The following will reliably throw some flavor of interop exception ,0
6085,2842, As of now it is only possible to set the CalenderIdentifier property to tell the control which calender to use ,0
6086,2843, It is not possible to set the Hijri adjustment for the month of Ramadan Shaban though which can vary per region user some users like to use the adjustment of a different country ,0
6087,2844, The Windows Calender app show cases this feature with their calender when you set the alternative calender to Hijri a new setting shows up which is Hijri adjustment and it works nice ,0
6088,2845, I do not know how they achieved this though because there is no known API in UWP for it right now ,0
6089,2846, Not for any of the datetime controls anyway DatePicker CalenderView etc ,0
6090,2851, I do not know how they achieved this though because there is no known API in UWP for it more ,0
6091,2852, I am using a UK keyboard layout and keys such as do not work ,0
6092,2853, ApplicationView SuppressSystemOverlays has been deprecated for a while and the warning message says use TryEnterFullScreenMode instead ,0
6093,2854, However there is an important difference in behavior that has prevented is from switching ,0
6094,2856, When you use full screen mode StatusBar ShowAsync does not work ,0
6095,2857, To give you some context why this matters to us our app is a video streaming app with both VoD and live TV content ,0
6096,2858, When the user starts video playback on a phone we use SuppressSystemOverlays to hide the navigation bar on devices such as Lumia that has them and status bar ,0
6097,2859, But we turn the status bar back to visible along with other playback controls when the user taps the screen ,0
6098,2860, The information in the status bar is highly relevant to a video app ,0
6099,2863, Sure we could replace the status bar with our own UI containing the same info ,0
6100,2871, When the user starts video playback on a phone we use SuppressSystemOverlays to hide the navigation bar on devices such as Lumia that has them more ,0
6101,2872, It seems it is still not possible to submit Edge Extensions to the store ,0
6102,2873, I think it is almost over a year ,0
6103,2878, Currently the Win D DirectionalBlurEffect is marked as NoComposition and can not be used with Composition APIs both in the Creator is Update and the new insider builds for the Fall Creator is Update ,0
6104,2888, Dotnet Framework can uncompressed and open this application or User Interface ,0
6105,2892, Once this client part is done we can have rest api is returning json data while maintaining session on server ,0
6106,2893, This new model of develpement can be used for both windows and web applciations ,0
6107,2895, So only differnce that makes it a windows application and web aplication is the url if pointing to local it is gonnabe windows standalone app elses it is gone be web app ,0
6108,2896, Which shoudl be configurable ,0
6109,2899, As soon this gets in to market due to the ease of development this should boom which eventually kill browser like chrome there angular concept thus again giving Microsoft a opportunity to beat others ,0
6110,2901, To label the developer as NET developer instead of windows developer or web application developer ,0
6111,2904, If I use anywhere in my UWP app BitmapIcon with UriSource about blank this can happen when using databinding the app crashes when navigating to other page which contains WebView ,0
6112,2905, Tested on Windows Creators Update VS ,0
6113,2906, percent repro is available in ZIP below ,0
6114,2917, Let us imagine that you drew a rectangle with yellow rounded corners and added the following text in it Login right after you have grouped it and now you want this to be a button simply you click convert to button and then click on toggle For XAML or click show XAML code and copy to clipboard then you just paste the code in Xamarin Forms in Visual Studio ,0
6115,2918, This would make life easier for millions of developers ,0
6116,2922, I am working on a motion blur effect as post process for which I am storing velocities into a render target ,0
6117,2924, However now I am stuck using DXGI FORMAT R G B A SNORM ,0
6118,2928, Both TimePicker and TimePickerFlyout support Hour and Minute and Period AM PM selection ,0
6119,2929, However second selection is often very useful and needed ,0
6120,2933, the ContentTemplateSelector is broken when binding to ViewModels ,0
6121,2934, This is a significant bug and kind of hard to believe it has not been fixed ,0
6122,2936, The following link appears to refer to the same bug ,0
6123,2937, After seven months the issue still has not been addressed ,0
6124,2945, you will get an error if the type of VM Data is not object ,0
6125,2947, represents a control that contains audio and or video ,0
6126,2949, Natively supported transition effects between one media and another ,0
6127,2951, Supports natively playing a playlist as an input ie a collection of URIs ,0
6128,2953, Infinite loop reproduction ,0
6129,2957, Video overlay support for example picture in picture ,0
6130,2960, Native support of SVG animation with SMIL inside XAML for Beautiful and Responsive UI and Hardware acceleration backend on OpenGL Direct D Vulkan Metal ,0
6131,2961, The advantage of XAML to natively support SVG with SMIL is that you as a developer would not have to worry about these icons and animations the design or animator could do that in other software and deliver SVGs to you ,0
6132,2966, In addition to being able to search on the internet SVG animated icons ready to use ,0
6133,2968, These are widely used in the real world today ,0
6134,2969, In several areas we find these types of control such as audio video playes visual programming animation software single multitracks audio editors video editors slide editors photo gallery websites social networks among many others ,0
6135,2992, The Backgroundtasks can currently be launched every minutes by the TimeTrigger ,0
6136,2993, Unfortunately if a task is launched via this TimeTrigger but appears idle to the Operating System then it is SUSPENDED ,0
6137,2994, This means the task can not execute for the full minute window ,0
6138,2998, My current Backgroundtask has a timer in it which would allow my background task to wake up on a timer event periodically do some processing then wait again ,0
6139,2999, This low amount of processing looks to be Idle so gets suspended ,0
6140,3005, If you either leave Idle tasks alone they are Idle so not using system resources right ,0
6141,3014, I like the way MSPoweruser app has implemented this feature ,0
6142,3015, In that app If we click Continue Reading button it will show all the devices connected to this device ,0
6143,3016, So if I click on a device it will open the app on that device with the same artice ,0
6144,3022, The Street and StreetNumber property of the MapLocationFinder FindLocationsAsync results have no value ,0
6145,3023, However street and house number are included correctly in the FormattedAddress property ,0
6146,3024, This bug occurs sine the Creators Update ,0
6147,3025, It does not have any sense to be forced to compile C # NET for all targets prior to uploading package to Windows Store ,0
6148,3027, What if Microsoft adds ARM target tomorrow ,0
6149,3036, I handle rendering the entire interface with my own commands using DirectX rendering ,0
6150,3038, This works briliantly with just few lines of code ,0
6151,3039, Which means there is no real simple API for UWP to do this and what I want is a simple API ,0
6152,3042, So many things to do compared to just drag and drop ,0
6153,3043, Also I have followed your links and it really sounds awfully complicated honestly I do not know where to start ,0
6154,3046, For example I drag and drop C emannoyed Folder image bmp file onto my app window and my app will generate C emannoyed Folder image png So what I need is a simple API like void OnFilesDropped String file names int window client pos x int window client pos y where ' file names ' is an array of full path names of all files folders drag and dropped onto the app and other parameters are the XY coordinates of the client window position where the drag and drop occured ,0
6155,3052, I do not want to use a File Picker or XAML ,0
6156,3055, I handle rendering the entire interface with my more ,0
6157,3059, Mark R for the win tegration ,0
6158,3061, this is most like ,0
6159,3066, App Service is not real time and not bi direction ,0
6160,3067, I have done some tests and to my surprise DXGI SWAP EFFECT FLIP DISCARD instead of bringing performance improvements it slows things down ,0
6161,3068, Nvidia GeForce m GT latest videos drivers April date ,0
6162,3069, Windows latest updates date ,0
6163,3071, I have made a simple application all it did was just clear the backbuffer several times and presented the screen ,0
6164,3072, In v sync mode I have cleared it more times to get below fps limit ,0
6165,3074, Why are you limiting UWP and DirectX to flip mode that is slower ,0
6166,3081, While BC is great the BC quality is not really good however we still need small size for textures as my game is currently over GB of texture data ,0
6167,3084, What happened to ASTC texture format ,0
6168,3085, Originally this was supposed to be included in DirectX but later was scrapped ,0
6169,3086, Are we going to see it eventually ,0
6170,3087, Currently I am using only texture formats ,0
6171,3092, If you have relocated your user folder somewhere else and the older Downloads folder remains if you add the old StorageFolder to the StorageApplicationPermissions FutureAccessList ,0
6172,3094, Currently it is really painful to add new Controls from newer Windows SDK versions to apps and still support older versions ,0
6173,3096, Ways this could potentially be fixed ,0
6174,3100, This would be really helpful when it comes to upcoming Fluent Design supporting new Fluent Design Styles and Supporting the Design Waves ,0
6175,3107, Like how Xamarin Forms does it instead of more ,0
6176,3110, I am especially interested in how this would work for my app to span different hardware types regardless of form factor or OS the idea of a seamless experience between Windows desktop and Android or iOS mobile is compelling but I need to see some examples before I invest ,0
6177,3112, I have read about Project Rome and the possibility of creating cross device experiences url and am particularly interested in the Project Rome Android SDK url ,0
6178,3117, a It is extremely slow ,0
6179,3119, b It draws MapPolygons blurred with jagged borders ,0
6180,3120, c It draws MapPolylines in wrong positions very very often ,0
6181,3121, They take right position then after manual shifting of map but initially percent of them are misplaced after being added to MapElements collection ,0
6182,3122, Most often it occurs near map borders ,0
6183,3130, The SDK itself support the side by side installation then we can try the new API with our UWP Apps ,0
6184,3131, But there are no way to distribute this kind of app to testers or customers that use Win Insider preview ,0
6185,3132, It only allow the Customer Update SDK level ,0
6186,3134, You know many of Microsoft Apps are updated with new SDK and it ' ll be available at the store during Insider Preview ,0
6187,3136, For example MS provide the lot of sdk and new technologies about Win Fall Cyou ,0
6188,3147, This is really a must for apps that target businesses or wish must to support older devices that will not get the latest versions ,0
6189,3149, uwp Media Element or MediaPlayerElement are fantastic with UI But their codecs to play different kinds of audio and video files is very limited ,0
6190,3151, Thankyou ,0
6191,3166, How can we ensure registration is complete for the COM server without adding regsvr command in post build and setting linker value for Register Output to false ,0
6192,3168, We see an error CLASS NOT REGISTERED message ,0
6193,3169, Saw the same issue with client app in PackagedComServer sample with those settings changed ,0
6194,3171, Link to the sample url ,0
6195,3181, Now I can create an attached property and assume it is already false and set that to the default however if I would like to check beforehand if the more ,0
6196,3185, Microsoft IME and JustSystems ATOK work fine ,0
6197,3187, Of course Win Apps and UWP Apps can use Goggle IME ,0
6198,3190, It scanned my entire computer for certification way outside the scope of building a UWP application ,0
6199,3191, It took an hour just to get through my STEAM library ,0
6200,3192, Cortana for Windows IoT core only supports English ,0
6201,3195, Ability to provide powerful animations in markup ,0
6202,3198, Especially for StringFormatConverter and FormatStingConverter ,0
6203,3200, I have not found an easy way to download payout summary in an automated fashion ,0
6204,3201, Probably not looked in the correct place yet ,0
6205,3202, Even went so far as to chat and the rep indicate that this not currently supported ,0
6206,3203, This would be insane ,0
6207,3204, I have reported sales information from many other sources ,0
6208,3210, The WebProxy property does not seem to have an impact on Windows systems ,0
6209,3212, When I try to call LaunchUriAsync or LaunchFileAsync in tablet mode the calling app will not show on the top app is loading and goes to background ,0
6210,3213, I see only start menu tiles ,0
6211,3214, It has not to be a full fledged Docking MDI Control like the ones from ,0
6212,3217, It appears that the MapIcon rendering by the MapControl has changed significantly with the Windows Creators update ,0
6213,3218, We have an app that at times adds hundreds of MapIcon objects to the MapControl ,0
6214,3219, Before Creators update this worked fine and the vast majority if not all were displayed ,0
6215,3220, After creators update we are only seeing a small portion of the MapIcon objects being rendered onto the map ,0
6216,3221, And it is not because they are colliding with other MapIcons ,0
6217,3222, We are seeing large portions of the map not displaying any of the MapIcons we have added ,0
6218,3223, We have always been aware of the guidance that a MapIcon is not guaranteed to be displayed but it is never been a problem ,0
6219,3224, We have even tried setting MapElementCollisionBehavior RemainVisible but it does not make much difference ,0
6220,3225, It seems like there is now some sort of internal limit on how many MapIcons are displayed at a time ,0
6221,3226, I could not find anything in the release notes about this change ,0
6222,3227, Is this change in behavior expected or a bug ,0
6223,3235, The UWP scrollbar is white and is invisible on a light background ,0
6224,3236, It can only be seen on a dark background ,0
6225,3239, The skeleton tracking is not working on XBOX ,0
6226,3241, MediaFrameSourceKind Custom is not available on the XBOX ,0
6227,3242, It is available on the computer though ,0
6228,3252, As a result skeletal tracking apps do not work on the XBOX platform ,0
6229,3254, The UWP application platform has a rich media API which allows querying of a video device example ,0
6230,3255, the Kinect and seeing if it supports things like ExposureControl ,0
6231,3258, The auto exposure function causes major headaches for the app I am working on and I would dearly love to be able to turn it off ,0
6232,3260, I have noticed that when you create a DataPackage containing both data provided directly let us say text using SetData and delayed formats like a bitmap using SetDataProvider when closing the application the whole clipboard content is cleared ,0
6233,3262, In VS and maybe in the compiler raised a warning that we missed that stated some of our code was currently unsupported by the UWP toolchain ,0
6234,3263, This led to a runtime crash that took a long time to figure out ,0
6235,3266, warning SG Cannot generate serialization code for type ' ' ,0
6236,3267, The ' MethodName ' property of the KnownTypeAttribute on type ' ObjectModel Entities BaseThing ' is not currently supported ,0
6237,3272, Like you are already doing with the XAML part the app is automatically reloaded without being shut down and relaunched ,0
6238,3274, It could save us developers a lot of time ,0
6239,3275, There is only one direction for the radial progress bar control clockwise ,0
6240,3281, But the xbox one does not provide any diagnostics data of apps example ,0
6241,3282, memory CPyou consumption etc ,0
6242,3283, There is a section for that in the device portal but there is currently not data ,0
6243,3286, Users are asking me frequently for a XBox version of my app ,0
6244,3289, It is just the same like with mobile ,0
6245,3290, Here we have several emulators and I usually make use of them first instead of plugging a device immediately ,0
6246,3291, Even more important XBox has a limited API with respect to desktop and mobile ,0
6247,3292, NetworkInformation object not available etc ,0
6248,3294, Personally I will not enable XBox without having tested my app first at least in an emulator ,0
6249,3299, Unfortunately I do not own a XBox nor would getting one make sense it is a free app so I am not really interested in spending lots of money just for developing purpose ,0
6250,3302, Here we have several emulators and I usually make use of them first instead of more ,0
6251,3303, In Windows Messages for example there is a very nice control for entering selecting contacts to send an email or text message etc to ,0
6252,3305, The control would include a field for required ContactFieldTypes ,0
6253,3307, The FileOpenPicker has the SuggestedStartLocation and the official description of how it works is ,0
6254,3308, The SuggestedStartLocation is not always used as the start location for the file picker ,0
6255,3312, In this situation SuggestedStartLocation makes it more confusing because when the user tries to pick a music file the FileOpenPicker is opening in the PicturesLibrary ,0
6256,3317, So SuggestedStartLocation remembers where you were and continues to open that same folder every time ,0
6257,3321, mobile phone CPyou temperature ,0
6258,3322, I noticed this problem as soon as I adapted my app to use ImageEx ,0
6259,3323, I use an event to change opacity to once the image is loaded and sized and immediately I noticed that instead of just displaying the image faded in with a second animation ,0
6260,3324, This animation seems hard coded into the style so to get rid of it I would have to redefine the style ,0
6261,3325, A real pain just to get rid of the animation ,0
6262,3337, One of the problems I encounter is my inability to get Jack Info as in IKsJackDescription GetJackDescription ,0
6263,3338, I saw new post and I confirmed that the problem was fixed following URL ,0
6264,3340, Thanks for fixing an issue ,0
6265,3341, But I noticed that it still happens no sound issue in another situation ,0
6266,3342, Ofcourse I am using Windwos Creators Update Version ,0
6267,3344, neither foreground nor FullTrustProcess ,0
6268,3345, It sounds normally after reboot OS ,0
6269,3347, We have a very large WPF application built upon the Virtual Earth API with heavy customization of the rendering pipeline ,0
6270,3350, Currently MultiSelectModel does not work as documented ,0
6271,3351, Player Your app is activated one time ,0
6272,3352, All of the selected files are passed to your app as argument parameters ,0
6273,3353, As far as Anniversary Update and Creators Update are concerned MultiSelectModel has no effect and only one file is passed as argument to the application regardless of how many files have been selected in Explorer ,0
6274,3354, Please support the passing of all selected files as command arguments ,0
6275,3355, All the documentation on how to call UWP methods are in C # and require the NET platform ,0
6276,3356, Is there a low level C interface as well ,0
6277,3358, Many developer will be bringing java python etc applications to the Windows Store via the Desktop Bridge ,0
6278,3361, Master Panel in MasterDetailsView was intended to be used as PullToRefreshListView because usually the ListView in Master Panel is dynamically changing It is often used for showing Collections of Emails Articles etc ,0
6279,3363, It would save the user a lot of time and effort ,0
6280,3364, Future access list is great in theory but adds too much overhead ,0
6281,3367, How UWP apps can compete with other systems with such things ,0
6282,3372, Not mentioning that some kind of apps need more than file access why to give such a handicap for the whole platform ,0
6283,3375, BTW seems that FutureAccessList sometimes has bugs and people are leaving platform and more ,0
6284,3376, Make DataTemplate behave like Xamarin Forms DataTemplate class where you have constructors ,0
6285,3379, DataTemplate Func object This one provides lot of flexibility ,0
6286,3380, The Windows Store analytics API is great ,0
6287,3383, The most important data is the Conversions breakdown by campaign ID table at the bottom of the page ,0
6288,3384, Currently UWP can not open WASAPI output devices in capture mode due to COM restrictions ,0
6289,3385, This means loopback auto capture is not supported ,0
6290,3392, Until now I can not find any api or documents about this ,0
6291,3393, We have a MediaPlayer that works with OneDrive MKV streams in previous versions but not in Creators Update ,0
6292,3395, Player raises SourceNotSupported error ,0
6293,3397, Now that the MarkdownTextBlock control supports fenced code blocks ``` in version language specific syntax highlighting would be the next step example ,0
6294,3399, But that would be beyond what the control should do in terms of separation of concerns ,0
6295,3401, The function would get the original text and is expected to return either XAML objects or maybe a more abstract of representation of colored text which is then handled by the control ,0
6296,3406, The function would get the original text and is expected to return either XAML objects or maybe a more abstract of representation of colored text which is then handled by more ,0
6297,3409, I am talking about this website ,0
6298,3411, The problem is it always provides the latest version only ,0
6299,3414, This is really important not only for menus toolbar buttons ,0
6300,3415, For example one thing I can not do right now is a simple search popup that would let me keep focus in where I am searching similar to how search in Cortana works ,0
6301,3416, Background audio playback working on Build does not work on Build ,0
6302,3428, At the moment there is no easy way to prevent a one way binding from clearing when a DependencyProperty is set to a new value ,0
6303,3431, Our desktop application displays a dialog using the GetOpenFileName API function access to the Network Drive may fail ,0
6304,3432, There is no problem when accessing by computer name ,0
6305,3433, It does not always result in an error ,0
6306,3437, I use them in the speech SDK for a desktop application and are now trying to use them in a UWP app ,0
6307,3439, I have written a helper for binding to and from Observables similar to frameworks like angular ,0
6308,3441, it is currently available at url ,0
6309,3443, System is deleting and recreating the TLS self signed certificates for the device portal on port a lot sometimes every minutes in the windows log ,0
6310,3444, For sure it resets them every reboot ,0
6311,3446, When you view an exception you get a completely useless stacktrace with only hex values for function names because of optimization ,0
6312,3447, We can not use that at all ,0
6313,3449, This enumeration is mainly used with AppBarButton like as AppBarButton Icon Smile ,0
6314,3450, Recent Segoe MDL asset have many of new glyphs ,0
6315,3451, But the enumeration of Symbol is not updated from Win ,0
6316,3452, And some of important glyphs of are also lacked from the enumeration ,0
6317,3454, For example Share glyph xE D is not enumerated ,0
6318,3457, But many of developers do not ,0
6319,3458, Like Photo app ,0
6320,3467, This cause the many of engineers use the bitmap or other similar glyphs ,0
6321,3473, This is still happening I have tested it myself now after the update to ,0
6322,3474, My users are also reporting the same problem and some of them say they resign of the app platform ,0
6323,3475, and I must say that I completely understand them ,0
6324,3476, How we the developers are supposed to work when such important thing like access to files is not working after the OS update ,0
6325,3477, This affects many of the apps and in result the whole platform ,0
6326,3478, The FutureAccessList has an issue ,0
6327,3479, After a firmware update for my phone I was unable to retrieve folders files from a token ,0
6328,3480, The token I was asking for was present in the FutureAccessList but it gave me a FileNotFoundException ,0
6329,3481, As the pervious post has been marked as completed url I am rising the problem again ,0
6330,3490, Please let me know if you would like to use this as the code itself is ready to go and easy to use ,0
6331,3492, Today only SelectRange ItemIndexRange itemIndexRange exists in ListView to add new selection range to the current selection and SelectedRanges property is only get ,0
6332,3495, Expected behavior ,0
6333,3498, After releasing the pointer or finger the list abruptly return to position and the refresh indicator is hidden ,0
6334,3499, I noticed there is a possibility to block payments in the interface of my Windows Store developer account but it is a Boolean ,0
6335,3500, Would it be possible to get paid only a certain amount leaving the remainder blocked on the MS account ,0
6336,3502, And the interest for MS would be obvious ,0
6337,3503, We live in a connected world ,0
6338,3504, And I have a connected app that benefits from fast low latency networks but can work with a larger buffer if need be ,0
6339,3507, Textbox that indicates Validation Results This Filed is Required ,0
6340,3514, For consistency sakes requesting same from all async awaitable s ,0
6341,3515, In an ideal world I should be able to invoke a task and than optionally send it somewhere else for continuation or just forget about it ,0
6342,3518, Right now the APIs only allow recognition of text input ,0
6343,3519, I know Microsoft already has the digital ink recognition technology for math formulas ,0
6344,3520, It is even available in WPF via Math Input Control ,0
6345,3524, It seems that since around when showing LoggingChannel LogMessage calls the string message portion is blank in device portal shows stringmessage emhappy ,0
6346,3525, Same code on machine with anniversary update portal shows the string message in payload ,0
6347,3526, capturing events with xperf shows the message in EventData as expected so I know it is logging correctly ,0
6348,3529, This Idea has already been posted for WinRT years ago url ,0
6349,3531, The main scenario is MVVM and resolving a View from a ViewModel ,0
6350,3532, This scenario is described in this post url ,0
6351,3537, Currently the only way to set BackgroundDownloader is header is by SetHeader method unfortunately once you set the heder value you cannot clear it as the method ,0
6352,3539, This method can be called multiple times for the same header ,0
6353,3540, The values will then be concatenated ,0
6354,3541, The problem comes when we want to create multiple downloads with one downloader if the server requires to send request via headers we are not able to downloaded files items within one downloader every item requires to create a new downloader instance with new headers ,0
6355,3542, Of course in that case we cannot use grouped toast notification ,0
6356,3549, Request for an editable combo box that allows ,0
6357,3550, Currently page breaks are not supported with the PrintHelper ,0
6358,3553, Currently it is possible to specify multiple groups subgroups within the various tile sizes for adaptive tiles but if the content does not fit then some groups will not necessarily ever be shown they are dropped since the tile can not fit the groups ,0
6359,3555, I recently browsed the UWP docs and found some interesting APIs about Accessory Management etc ,0
6360,3559, For me it is perfectly acceptable to request access to them so they are still under control but I do not want to create a company account for this ,0
6361,3560, Without APIs you are losing customers to Android iOS as many people would love to have apps which can control their volume system theme etc ,0
6362,3562, Current steps are outlined here ,0
6363,3566, Since I developed an application which could massively profit from those APIs as they allow volume control etc I wanted to use them ,0
6364,3567, Unfortunately for me I cannot use those APIs as they are restricted for use and getting access is only possible with a company developer account which I do not have ,0
6365,3569, For me it is perfectly acceptable to request access to them so they are still under control but I do not want to create more ,0
6366,3571, I have lost count of the number of times I have forgot to set it to OneWay ,0
6367,3573, Yes I know why it is not but looking at my code nearly every instance is set to OneWay or TwoWay anyway ,0
6368,3576, On both the mobile and desktop versions of the Store app you can browse these categories ,0
6369,3577, However this feature is not present in the Store app on the Xbox ,0
6370,3578, Unless your app makes it into the Top Apps sections or Promoted apps then users can only download your app if they know about it and search for it by name themselves ,0
6371,3579, If their app like mine is published solely to the Xbox then it makes it very hard for users to become aware of your app ,0
6372,3580, When you publish an app in Dev Center it allows you to select the category and subcategory for the app to be placed into ,0
6373,3584, If their app like mine is published solely to the Xbox then it makes it more ,0
6374,3588, If you have no more disk space the install crashed ,0
6375,3590, The combination of toasts and Action Center provide a convenient lightweight way to communication with users but after notifications are read they disappear ,0
6376,3592, I am currently working on a clock control for my UWP todo list app Day url ,0
6377,3593, I am creating this control using inspiration from the great Material Design WPF toolkit ,0
6378,3594, The very early work in progress version is available on my repo url ,0
6379,3597, In UWP we have a CommandBar but it seems it is not easy to use to build a classic toolbar for a desktop application ,0
6380,3601, But as this is such a central control it should be part of the platform ,0
6381,3603, I ve spent some hours to build a small MVVM UWP Pivot Prototype that does the typical stuff we do today in WPF with TabControl ,0
6382,3604, And I was impressed how far I got ,0
6383,3611, Currently the Pivot has no overflow panel ,0
6384,3612, It s also not wrapping the headers ,0
6385,3614, I didn t find the option ,0
6386,3616, I created a separate uservoice entry ,0
6387,3617, Styling of content I was not able to get rid of that entrance animation slide in from the left animation transition ,0
6388,3618, allow for no overflow ,0
6389,3619, allow for no wrapping ,0
6390,3628, Big asks are asks are more ,0
6391,3629, You are building on a TreeView control as your backlog on url shows ,0
6392,3630, I am using the TreeView of your official samples on url ,0
6393,3631, The point that I really miss when working with hierarchical data is the HierarchicalDataTemplate like we have it today in WPF ,0
6394,3633, It makes especially sense when you release a control for hierarchical data like the TreeView ,0
6395,3634, entries as limit for FutureAccessList is way to low ,0
6396,3637, Best practice until now ,0
6397,3638, Store the folder containing the file wont exceed the limit as fast as storing each file in the FutureAccessList ,0
6398,3639, One Exception where a folder can not be added ,0
6399,3640, A big downside hides in DragDrop url ,0
6400,3642, To counter that and trying to add the folder from the file this will not be possible because an exception would be thrown even if you added the file itself to the FutureAccessList before that ,0
6401,3643, Example trying to add folder from dragDrop Filetarget to FutureAccessList ,0
6402,3655, We are not able to add this folder ,0
6403,3673, I do not for how long but I noticed it a few days back that there is a change in de Windows app store seacchresults ,0
6404,3675, computer apps are harder to find this way ,0
6405,3676, Also I noticed that in the Mobile store apps are shown twice after search with a keyword ,0
6406,3678, Is this new policy or is it a bug ,0
6407,3683, When building line of business apps for enterprises we often focus on desktop only ,0
6408,3684, Today we are using WPF for these tasks ,0
6409,3689, Similar request but a report control for rdlc support ,0
6410,3692, Currently it is nearly impossible to create a custom virtualizing panel ,0
6411,3694, But in UWP it is impossible because the base classes have private constructors and the other classes are sealed ,0
6412,3695, A lot of custom controls do not use virtualization because it is so hard to implement in UWP ,0
6413,3696, This makes the controls hard or even impossible to use with large collections ,0
6414,3699, AdControl on Xbox in Retail Mode crashes app works fine in Dev Mode or on Desktop Mobile ,0
6415,3700, Something has changed in the Microsoft Store Services SDK framework or in the Microsoft Advertising SDK for XAML library that is updated automatically to the Xbox since date ,0
6416,3701, To repro download any app from the store which contains ads and it will instantly crash on the spash screen ,0
6417,3704, All the other platforms support this Net Silverlight Android Xamarin and even iOS Xamarin ,0
6418,3705, Why is the UWP team stubbornly resisting this ,0
6419,3707, Other platforms allow for customization to be downloaded and dynamically loaded in to the app domain ,0
6420,3708, With apps increasingly going the encrypted route our app EarTrumpet is finding it harder and harder to retrieve the running appx app is current application icon ie ,0
6421,3711, APIs is messy and not appropriate for loading scale sensitive assets ,0
6422,3712, Parsing the PRI is only possible in unencrypted appx scenarios ,0
6423,3714, The current options have the current drawbacks for me ,0
6424,3719, There are genuine use cases when we need to keep an app running when close button is pressed ,0
6425,3727, You can only allow an app to catch close button event and minimise it to task bar programatically ,0
6426,3734, Currently I have to save a MP stream to a file and then read from the file and transmit it over TCP ,0
6427,3738, One Scenario is that of a shoutcast source for Internet Radio streaming ,0
6428,3739, A shoutcast source transmits MP data via TCP to a shoutcast Server ,0
6429,3743, Currently an in process appservice can be invoked without actually launching the main app ui ,0
6430,3744, However once a user launch the main app ui and close it appservice is also terminated because both shared same process ,0
6431,3750, This control is not to be confused with the existing pivot viewer in UWP ,0
6432,3751, This control makes a great addition for displaying large amounts of data in a visual friendly format ,0
6433,3753, The control is the equivalent of a pivot table in excel you simply add the datasets with labels and the control sorts out all the selection fields visualizations and animations ,0
6434,3754, This was the original microsoft link for the pivot control in Silverlight ,0
6435,3756, Related to feature request ,0
6436,3763, It might be necessary to ensure the downloaded base images are not corrupted and it would be very nice for you to provide them ,0
6437,3765, I cannot port my Windows Phone Silverlight App to UWP because it is depending on the Panorama Control which is missing in UWP ,0
6438,3768, The Hub control is not a suitable replacement ,0
6439,3773, Use case As neither Groove nor Spotify have a lyrics functionality anymore I created a simple UWP app to manage lyrics for songs ,0
6440,3782, Following data would be great ,0
6441,3788, Linked to GitHub url ,0
6442,3799, There is SystemTriggerType PowerStateChange but it is not triggered when percent is changed ,0
6443,3800, So one of two options would be useful ,0
6444,3802, Right now to show something on lock screen we have text and icon notifications at the bottom ,0
6445,3817, There is no way to implement complex text markup rendering without Direct D or slow manual composition inside Canvas control ,0
6446,3818, There is absolutely no easy way to implement selectable text with complex markup ,0
6447,3819, RichEditBox control exists but there is no lightweight control for just display rich text RichTextBlock is not related to RichEditBox and feature lame ,0
6448,3820, The ToastNotification object has a convenient ExpirationTime property that automatically dismisses it after a given period ,0
6449,3821, Unfortunately the ScheduledToastNotification which is just a ToastNotofcation but scheduled lacks this helping feature ,0
6450,3822, This makes me as a developer scracth my head and write a lot of code including background tasks just so I circumvent this problem and not have the users of my app get crowded with not so relevant anymore notifications in their action center ,0
6451,3824, The MapControl is quite limited in operations with custom tiles ,0
6452,3825, I have need to redraw the tiles periodically because they become outdated the closest similar example is traffic layer which needs to be periodically refreshed ,0
6453,3827, Even more since this operation results in tiles flickering because of redraw I have to use tile sources switching between them ,0
6454,3828, That crasy staff involves heavy redrawing of the map and it also leads to visble scrolling slowing down in the moment of MapTileSource adding which would be nice to fix too ,0
6455,3833, The ugly workaround I use is adding and removing MapTileSource which forces tiles redraw ,0
6456,3836, Currently UWP apps have no ability to include menu controls with excellent mouse support ,0
6457,3847, One click to close the first menu and a second click to open the new one ,0
6458,3849, At the moment there is no possibility to quickly navigate through long lists on small screens ,0
6459,3851, But sometimes lists are not in alphabetic order or there are still thousands of entries starting with the same letter ,0
6460,3852, I don t know what the component should look like ,0
6461,3855, If the list is alphabetic there is at least the possibility to jump to the first entry with the same first letter ,0
6462,3859, I want to test my apps in multiple languages without changing the region of my entire device ,0
6463,3869, I am developing a Windows Universal App and I am sicked and tired of finding a way to implement encrypted local DB support ,0
6464,3870, I already have a database file encrypted by SQL Cipher and I just have to read the records ,0
6465,3872, But SQLCipher is not it supports only commercial edition money and I can not afford the expense ,0
6466,3874, Surprisingly NO ONE OF THEM supports Universal App implementation ,0
6467,3875, That is ridiculous and I am sick and tired of finding the way ,0
6468,3876, Does Microsoft really NOT support local database in developing Universal App ,0
6469,3877, I can not understand why I am confused in this situation which is possible on Android or iOS so easy ,0
6470,3882, I know SQLite support Universal App Development through Nuget in VS ,0
6471,3886, That is ridiculous and I am sick and tired more ,0
6472,3887, Basic scenario is the need to store set of secret API keys for various rd party APIs twitter for example ,0
6473,3896, Just to hardcode API keys inside app executable files is security risk as it can be reverse engeneered ,0
6474,3901, Hello there is currently a bug withing the insider preview for desktop and phone ,0
6475,3903, Mouse scrolling works fine and it was also tested on the normal Windows builds where it was working as intended ,0
6476,3905, And I created this thread on the MSDN forum where it was confirmed that this is an insider preview bug url ,0
6477,3906, You can also find a code sample here ,0
6478,3912, I found this thread on Github url ,0
6479,3919, Could do something like ,0
6480,3925, td style ' ' My teste here td ,0
6481,3932, This is reproducible in the XamlAnimatedGif sample app on Win Desktop ,0
6482,3938, Notice animated GIFs appear ,0
6483,3944, At least one of the animated GIFs will disappear ,0
6484,3945, Eventually they all disappeared for me ,0
6485,3948, This facility exist for public store apps but not LOB ones ,0
6486,3952, I find myself writing this control over and over in various projects and it is never vey good ,0
6487,3958, Allow panning and zooming ,0
6488,3965, It also creates a large hurdle for new users and causes a number of headaches ,0
6489,3966, The issue is that our software uses ui access to emulate an onscreen touchpad and custom gestures ,0
6490,3967, We also allow for simultaneous pen and touch to add touch keyboard hotkeys to a docked custom keyboard typically aids in drawing and ink based applications ,0
6491,3970, I love what you guys are doing and can not tell you enough how much anticipation I have to get in touch with you guys and find the answers to these questions ,0
6492,3972, It would mean the world to me ,0
6493,3978, our question is would converting our app to use newer windows ink code forgive my lack of knowledge here and if more ,0
6494,3980, Here are some more things I would appreciate ,0
6495,3982, the scaling of the website sometimes does not work ,0
6496,3985, I do not know if it is only me but I can not kill a running process but i can stop a running app ,0
6497,3988, execution on every restart ,0
6498,3990, text and parts of graphs are not wisible because it disappears below ,0
6499,3992, I do not know if it is only me but I can not more ,0
6500,3996, Currently SmartCard API does not have any method to force a reader to reset smartcard Cold Reset or Warm Reset as described in ISO ,0
6501,3997, It is important as fallback mechanism when the smart card is not responding ,0
6502,4001, This is really way too long in UWP Xaml not addressed ,0
6503,4002, public static readonly DependencyProperty IsTestProperty DependencyProperty Register nameof IsTest typeof bool ,0
6504,4005, I have two versions of my app one for Windows Phone v x x x and another one for Windows Mobile v x x x ,0
6505,4006, Latter uses new features of Windows and receives excellent reviews but store mixes them with worse ratings from Windows Phone users ,0
6506,4008, My app users are reporting that they can not get information about my durable add on on the Xbox One and Xbox One S ,0
6507,4009, When my code checks for the property AddOnLicenses the collection is empty for users that have purchased the add on ,0
6508,4010, We have tried with ExtendedJsonData property but the add on array is empty too ,0
6509,4011, We can not determine if the add on is active and neither the expiration date ,0
6510,4016, When user invoke the access key of a button to navigate out the AccessKeyDisplayDismissed event of the command bar button is not invoked ,0
6511,4018, When the user pressed the access key of a button to navigate out the tooltips of command bar buttons stay where they are ,0
6512,4022, If a URL is required then either I have to use something like OneDrive which I think looks a bit unprofessional or I have to create a web page which requires hosting etc and either way it creates an extra separate thing for me to have to manage and remember ,0
6513,4026, I would prefer it if everything to do more ,0
6514,4027, When using Windows Media Transcoding MediaTranscoder to transcode ALAC file to something else it reports CodecNotFound ,0
6515,4028, However ALAC decoding is supported according to this page url ,0
6516,4029, More interestingly transcoding other files to ALAC works fine ,0
6517,4033, PrivateObject and PrivateType are missing in Microsoft VisualStudio TestPlatform UnitTestFramework ,0
6518,4034, On this page there is explanation how to make a file explorer integration on a desktop bridge app ,0
6519,4037, I m working on porting an app that could calculate MD checksums on a file ,0
6520,4038, I want to add this as a context menu option on for instance zip and iso files ,0
6521,4041, Also there is no way to having different verbs on different file types which could be quite limiting ,0
6522,4048, But it s not possible to do this without making a file type association as I get it emsad more ,0
6523,4049, We have a uwp in the store and a desktop companion app ,0
6524,4050, Currently to install our software and have it function both programs are needed ,0
6525,4053, The issue we run into is that our desktop app uses ui access ,0
6526,4054, Is ui access support on the list of upcoming features ,0
6527,4055, Having a good informed answer to this question will help tremendously in helping us understand how to proceed ,0
6528,4056, I would be beyond excited to get a response ,0
6529,4057, It would mean the world to our small team to hear from you all ,0
6530,4058, Some of our ui access features may be convertible to direct ink functionality would that be a worthwhile pursuit or would that leave us facing the same intersection from a different direction ,0
6531,4060, our app is called tablet pro it may be of use to know that ,0
6532,4068, Building our email list has been at the forefront of our small software companies goals for a few years ,0
6533,4069, Probably the biggest question I have is how to use the store without loosing our ability to acquire user emails without complicating the process for the end user ,0
6534,4071, I may simply be unaware of how this is done ,0
6535,4073, This would be HUGE ,0
6536,4076, We like a number of the benefits the store offers but it seems without a way to build an list of our clients independent of Microsoft or anyone but us for that matter is KEY ,0
6537,4078, Is there a process in place for gaining downloaders email addresses ,0
6538,4080, Since the advent of Silverlight PivotViewer Control shifted the handling of large datasets giving a way of filtering and analyzing large volumes of data ,0
6539,4082, For line of business applications processing large datasets ,0
6540,4084, Currently the ScrollViewer is content can be overpanned ,0
6541,4087, Support the last version of Net Standard ,0
6542,4088, Developing desktop apps for UWP is subpar as many API are not present like SqlClient ,0
6543,4091, The store does not allow a developer to update their response to a user is review once it is made public while users are allowed to update their reviews at will ,0
6544,4092, A user may change his review completely and the original response could become totally irrelevant ,0
6545,4095, I am attempting to design something to support functionality similar to Android is startActivityForResult using the page stacks but I have no visibility into the management of the page stacks BackStack and ForwardStack ,0
6546,4096, This introduces the opportunity for a memory leak as these stacks are pruned in response to user navigations ,0
6547,4099, WinRT information The maximum number of items in the access list has been reached ,0
6548,4106, This supports the use case for providing a detail view for both the underlying item represented by the Group Header Template as well as that of the represented by the ItemTemplate ,0
6549,4108, Currently I am prohibited from extending and overridding various methods in my case those concerning Navigation ,0
6550,4112, As a long time WP and now W M user I noticed inconsistent behavior of opening flyout with touch versus mouse ,0
6551,4115, Instead in W M it opens just when I release the finger ,0
6552,4116, This is very annoying as I never know if there is some additional menu under the item or not ,0
6553,4119, Context menu appears while my finger is still touching the screen ,0
6554,4123, But when using touch gesture I would expect behavior known from WP flyout aka context menu should open after couple miliseconds while my finger is still touching the given item ,0
6555,4128, I use IMFSourceReader on UWP and noticed following bug with FLAC decoding it will not change position if SetCurrentPosition will be called right after initialization ,0
6556,4129, It is working correct with mp and other codecs but not with FLAC ,0
6557,4131, This would allow apps to say they were listening to KEXP instead only and the station information as well ,0
6558,4136, With Silverlight in Windows Phone i had the ability to use FM radio APIs ,0
6559,4137, In UWP I cannot use these APIs as they were not brought over ,0
6560,4141, from an accessory device like a smartwatch possible ,0
6561,4142, Our desktop application provides users with custom contact data that we would like to sync for them with Windows contacts ,0
6562,4143, We are working on the Converted version of the app to enable such capabilities and to distribute our desktop app via the Windows Store but we have to distribute it for previous versions of Windows as well and so we can not afford having two completely different versions of the product for the time being ,0
6563,4145, Why do you always have to make a developer is life difficult ,0
6564,4146, There is no easy way to detect Left Control key pushes ,0
6565,4147, Because on international keyboards if Right Alt is pressed then Left Control is also pressed ,0
6566,4148, Why oh why this is the stupidest thing ever ,0
6567,4152, But that does not work too because now it turns out that if I press just RightAlt then I can get callbacks for LeftCtrl and RightAlt happening in different frames ,0
6568,4153, OnKeyDown with LeftCtrl gets called in frame ,0
6569,4154, OnKeyDown with RightAlt gets called in frame ,0
6570,4156, Waiting for reply ,0
6571,4162, So I have developed a work around to detect key pushes for LeftCtrl and RightAlt and if both are pressed at the same time then LeftCtrl pushes are ignored ,0
6572,4166, I want my user to stay inside my app ,0
6573,4172, I am using the result of MidiOutPort GetDeviceSelector for the device selector string ,0
6574,4173, The DeviceInformation for some of the virtual software ports on the system are returning with generic device names ,0
6575,4174, A user of yMidi contacted me about this problem ,0
6576,4175, He s using loopMidi a virtual MIDI loopback from Tobias Erichsen ,0
6577,4179, Have you seen this behavior before ,0
6578,4180, I m using the property DeviceInformation Name in my application to display the port name ,0
6579,4182, Using DeviceInformation FindAllAsync in my C CX application to enumerate existing MIDI ports on the system ,0
6580,4190, We just switched to Win SDK and are now getting some new warnings in cpp files with hashtag include Windows h ,0
6581,4191, Warning is an extra one we have enabled beyond warning level ,0
6582,4194, C emannoyed Program Files x Windows Kits Include um winioctl h warning C ' WIN WINNT WIN TH ' is not defined as a preprocessor macro replacing with ' ' for ' hashtag if hashtag elif ' compiling source file Src Win AppInsightsWin cpp ,0
6583,4200, Similar issue url ,0
6584,4201, Currently any UWP developer is forced to use C for accessing DirectX features or rely on third party support like SharpDX or Unity D for those features ,0
6585,4204, Currently a control will not be able to handle the request if the event has already been subscribed to in order to handle navigation ,0
6586,4207, This gave the MasterDetailsView the time it needed to subscribe to the event first in order to handle it ,0
6587,4208, In other projects frameworks like Template this is not as easily handled because those frameworks have a navigation service that subscribes to the BackRequested event first ,0
6588,4212, The only work around I found for the sample app was to unsubscribe from the event in the shell when the frame has navigated and then subscribe to the event again in the more ,0
6589,4214, But I mostly care about Windows Phone ,0
6590,4215, I can see the tasks but I can not terminate them ,0
6591,4218, I know you have tweaked alarm volume in Insider builds but you simply cannot cover all user need if you do not provide them the slider ,0
6592,4219, Many users still complains about given volume even fade in does not save the situation ,0
6593,4225, I assume it is the image for either the left or right eye ,0
6594,4226, When hololens is in stereo mode show both frames on the emulator ,0
6595,4229, Apparently the UIElement KeyUp and UIElement KeyDown events provide the wrong VirtualKey information in the KeyRoutedEventArgs ,0
6596,4230, The problem is when using a physical keyboard and also when using the On Screen Keyboard ,0
6597,4234, IBM layout the VirtualKey information is correct ,0
6598,4239, It is also a total annoyance when working with data that require handling of lots more ,0
6599,4242, We are limited at work since we can not use our mobile devices the way we want ,0
6600,4243, Right now WinAppDriver only works on desktop ,0
6601,4247, Before our users find them ,0
6602,4258, Right now it is not possible to add screenshots for AddOns in Windows Store ,0
6603,4259, This is especially limiting when browsing DLCs for games without any screenshots ,0
6604,4262, For example the minimum requirements Operating system Windows or later required ,0
6605,4266, However I am developing a Chinese zh TW app using MapControl on my computer ,0
6606,4267, Unfortunately we can not set the MapControl language by programming to a specific value ,0
6607,4268, MapControl always uses the Windows display language ,0
6608,4269, It is inconvenient for me to debug a Chinese app with MapControl while my favorite Windows display languages is en US ,0
6609,4279, I hardly understand why Store App Dev center requires Azure AD account for adding managers ,0
6610,4280, This work is not viable to indi devs url ,0
6611,4283, My app contains in app purchases but customers can not buy these in app purchases in the Windows Store for Business ,0
6612,4286, But that has a very big impact on maintenance because we would have to support apps ,0
6613,4289, Obviously the free SDK is a good start ,0
6614,4291, The current Windows Audio driver design only allows you to use channels simulatenously ,0
6615,4292, There are many devices like a USB Madi or Dante Virtual Soundcard which use at least channels ,0
6616,4294, This is a real problem ,0
6617,4297, I really hope this will change in the near future because for Pro Audio applications something really has to change ,0
6618,4308, Currently document function is disabled ,0
6619,4310, DownloadOperation BackgroundTransfer API restarts from when resumed after being paused at percent progress bytesReceived progress totalBytesToReceive and startAsync task has not completed ,0
6620,4315, The language Swift was created by Apple for use on iOS and macOS ,0
6621,4316, It was made open source in ,0
6622,4319, Desktop App Converter constantly fails with the E CREATING ISOLATED ENV FAILED error ,0
6623,4320, The inner exception that has sense is the System IO DirectoryNotFoundException ,0
6624,4322, System IO DirectoryNotFoundException The system cannot find the path specified ,0
6625,4323, Exception from HRESULT x ,0
6626,4324, Most probably the problem is in these two lines ,0
6627,4325, Setting up Conversion Environment ,0
6628,4326, I looked through the GUID named folder and found no SHARED folder inside ,0
6629,4327, So no contents of MyApp and no KnownFolderDump exe ,0
6630,4328, The dac folder exists but under output not under shared ,0
6631,4330, The question is how to fix that ,0
6632,4331, The problem occurs on every conversion ,0
6633,4332, PS I cannot try to create the folders in advance because each time the converter generates and uses a new GUID ,0
6634,4333, I tried three different installers InnoSetup a plain self extracting archive produced by zip and VLC Media Player from the video tutorial by Avneet Singh and David Tepper ,0
6635,4334, I am on Windows Pro x Version build ,0
6636,4336, Thank you for any advice ,0
6637,4347, And the dac folder more ,0
6638,4348, Dear Dev Team ,0
6639,4356, Wifi and bluetooth work well but the mobileBroadband is in This value is defined for future use and is not currently available ,0
6640,4358, Thank you ,0
6641,4359, Hello All ,0
6642,4363, This would mimic the Android capability that already exists for it is Navigation drawer ,0
6643,4364, I have actually implemented this in one of my apps so you can see it in action ,0
6644,4365, It is in an app called Drudge Live url and in the app the swipe open capability is only enabled on phones ,0
6645,4367, Based on feedback I have received the capability is very important because it allows the use and opening of hamburger menus on phones using one hand ,0
6646,4368, I was previously getting a lot of grief over the switch to a hamburger menu by phone users but this gives them back the ability to navigate with one hand on the phone ,0
6647,4376, However there seems to be no such accommodation for style definitions located either in ResourceDictionary files or embedded directly into the page XAML ,0
6648,4379, In code there is a way to detect and work with features that are in newer Windows builds using ApiInformation so that code can use new features while gracefully degrading on older builds ,0
6649,4381, If you have a style that uses a new property or enumeration value anyone opening the app in an older Win build will immediately crash ,0
6650,4383, It is a lot easier to build a following when it is free ,0
6651,4384, Keeping this in mind was thinking of making some of my products donationware ,0
6652,4386, The ability for an end user to donate allows me to make the app free ,0
6653,4390, Support for developers willing to get the apps converted and placed in the Windows store is below anecdotal ,0
6654,4392, Like thousands of other developers I have tried for now over a month to convert my app and followed every literatureput up by Microsoft but am still stuck with dependencies ,0
6655,4393, Tried to post in UWP apps but questions remain unanswered ,0
6656,4401, For such a strategic move where the Windows Store could remain indigent as during the painful Windows x era if nothing is done please make sure developers do not remain in the more ,0
6657,4403, I was working with WebView to display static HTML and I found an issue ,0
6658,4405, The li table tags are displayed very small in size ,0
6659,4410, You can check using below example ,0
6660,4411, The WNS currently does not seem to support loc key loc args APNS equivalents ,0
6661,4413, As a result all of the notification strings have to be generated server side iterating for all the languages supported by the client like url ,0
6662,4414, This causes us to treat the windows platform as a special case while APNS GCM provide a single cohesive story ,0
6663,4415, This gets even more painful when we work with client application teams that want to customize the localized strings for their platform for a loc key loc args contract ,0
6664,4420, This gets even more painful when we work with client application teams more ,0
6665,4423, Currently the xaml engine of UWP does not manage complex control attributes since it does not take System ComponentModel TypeConverter into account ,0
6666,4424, That is why we can not write this simple xaml user code ,0
6667,4425, where the complex property is Begin and the complex value is that represents a position X Y ,0
6668,4427, By the way that will be a lot simpler than the WPF is TypeConverter ,0
6669,4437, After having tried TypeConverter on UWP I tried to add implicit operators casts to the complex type Position here from and to string but xaml does not take them into account ,0
6670,4439, All my tests and researches made be waste two days for nothing ,0
6671,4444, Tested with VS under Windows ,0
6672,4458, Once you create a CoreIndependentInputSource touch visual feedback is visible again ,0
6673,4459, Even if you disabled it using ,0
6674,4463, It is not about aesthetics Visualfeedback kills performance the framerate in games drops by half which is ironic if you think that is the kind of apps CoreIndependentInputSource was created for in the first place ,0
6675,4466, CoreIndependentInputSource has it is own Dispatcher does that mean it has it is own HWND message queue ,0
6676,4467, Maybe that is the cause of the bug PointerVisualizationSettings GetForCurrentView is tied to the main Window ,0
6677,4469, I got the hWnd from CoreIndependentInputSource Dispacher using the VS debug inspector and then called TryDisableWindowsVisualFeedback as seen here url ,0
6678,4470, The visual feedback was disabled ,0
6679,4471, However live code has no access to that hWnd ,0
6680,4472, All helpful Win apis fail one way or another GetActiveWindow GetProccessId EnumWindows etc ,0
6681,4482, WACK will be an error by some applications ,0
6682,4483, Wack show An error occurred while generating the report ,0
6683,4485, Of couse another app have success of wack ,0
6684,4486, I have a question related WACK ,0
6685,4487, When this issue specified test features ,0
6686,4489, then can not show apps list so I selected an appx package ,0
6687,4490, To choose what test features is it right ,0
6688,4492, I have a question related more ,0
6689,4493, I need to select multiple files to be downloaded uploaded one time ,0
6690,4495, I also want to create folders to store things in ,0
6691,4496, Seriously while we see a LOT of improvement of ASP Net Razor languages and even the C # language reducing a LOT of verbosity in each version with a lot of awesome new features XAML got what in the last years ,0
6692,4498, Seriously to be honest we LOSE a lot of features with transition of WPF UWP DockPanels Adorners etc ,0
6693,4503, In Windows Store the longer app is titles or capitalized app is titles for example COBATA X HTML Constructor are cut to characters doing the app is title meaningless for example COBATA X HTML ,0
6694,4504, It is because the responsible HTML element c heading class font size style property is fixed to px ,0
6695,4516, How this could work more ,0
6696,4517, When there is a bulk update requirement as with the age ratings and soon to be with the Ad support changes the store is poorly equipped to server those of us that are managing large portfolios and millions of users ,0
6697,4519, Right now I have to manage this myself ,0
6698,4520, The current status only seems to show In Progress if the app has never been put in the store before ,0
6699,4521, I have lots of apps that are just now showing that they have passed certification days after simply doing the Age Rating update ,0
6700,4527, I have lots of apps that are just now showing that they more ,0
6701,4528, Right now RichEditBox only supports input and output in RTF format ,0
6702,4530, HTTP sys serves as the kernel component backing IIS and the NET HttpListener ,0
6703,4532, There are a number of failure cases such as a high incoming request rate filling the request queue that can result in the module rejecting incoming requests directly without handing them off to callers higher on the stack ,0
6704,4534, Information about these failed requests is currently only visible via the HTTPERR log file and a few Perf counters ,0
6705,4535, Neither is ideal ,0
6706,4536, The log file is system wide requires admin access and lacks any information about what request queue the error is associated with ,0
6707,4541, As such it plays a critical role as the first system to process each incoming HTTP request but it is unfortunately lacking in diagnostics ,0
6708,4543, This leaves the application unaware that it it experiencing such problems ,0
6709,4544, Information about these failed requests is currently only visible via the HTTPERR log file and more ,0
6710,4546, And the RelativeTime it seems not correct sometimes the Duration is larger than RelativeTime ,0
6711,4547, Sometimes the previous frame is RelativeTime is time but the next frame is RelativeTime is time ,0
6712,4548, I am confused what the is that ,0
6713,4550, Also the AudioGraph can not to be ensure generate ms of AudioFrame data even though I have set the QuantumSizeSelectionMode property to ClosestToDesired ,0
6714,4551, This is bad for signal analysis scenario ,0
6715,4554, When submitting fixing the Age Ratings Age Ratings the dev center will not let me submit more than or in a row ,0
6716,4556, When initiating a chat session the page asks you to let the operator know what the issue is and provides a virtually limitless text field ,0
6717,4557, There is no indication that the text field will only transmit the first characters to the support technician but that apparently is the limit ,0
6718,4559, This ends up further frustrating an already distressed developer and making the job that much harder for the support operator needlessly ,0
6719,4563, This leads the user to have to type AGAIN the whole description ,0
6720,4566, The name reservation field does not accept spaces ,0
6721,4574, loopMIDI is also an example of this in the MIDI realm allowing on the fly creation destruction renaming of virtual MIDI ports although lacking the routing filtering layer which MIDI OX is primitive GUI routing filtering is a good example of ,0
6722,4576, Some of the above is already possible today there is some Virtual Audio Cable solutions but it is cumbersome non standard and definetely not done optimized ,0
6723,4579, All the above is also somewhat possible today but there is no OS based unified paradigm easily controllable by the user ,0
6724,4584, There has been a huge spike in spammers scraping the Windows Store website for apps isupport email ,0
6725,4585, The automated script leaves a star review and asks that you do the same for their app ,0
6726,4588, I recenlty rated your app url with stars and caption and text ' Great Tool ' ' I will admit that installing this app was an ordeal ,0
6727,4589, I want to thank Lancelot for taking the time to communicate quickly with me ,0
6728,2914, have an exporter for a Adobe emlaugh file that could translate to XAML ,1
6729,2921, and it would be great to have a signed version DXGI FORMAT R G B A SNORM ,1
6730,2939, Add support to allow WCF services to be consumed that have custom username password authentication on the binding ,1
6731,2987, I believe that everyone in XAML lovers we want a robust and complete standard and that facilitates the life of the developer so I propose to include these controls as a standard of XAML specification ,1
6732,3007, or allow minute or maybe even minute TimeTriggers to be used ,1
6733,3009, I would like from the device portal the ability to reset the device ,1
6734,3010, Create a control for Continue in different device Like Continue Reading etc ,1
6735,3012, So it would be nice to create controls to achieve Microsoft is vision easily ,1
6736,3026, I would like my apps be automatically supported on any new processor architectures ,1
6737,3031, Please add simple API ,1
6738,3056, The application XBOX DEV MODE COMPANION should have an option to make it a VR ,1
6739,3058, Make it something unique windows phone attracting more customers ,1
6740,3097, Have a separate Class Library that only supports new SDK versions and it will only be loaded into the app on newer SDK versions therefore you can write safe XAML markup including new Controls and Properties ,1
6741,3101, Alternatively it would be nice if the UWP platform was updated separately from Windows so apps would be able to support all the new Controls Styles ,1
6742,3104, There needs to be a way to define new XAML Controls Properties Etc as currently if you want to add these with a lower Minimum version it has to be from code behind ,1
6743,3109, I would like to try this out making my app an experience shared across multiple close proximity devices but it would be very helpful to see some code samples ,1
6744,3128, There should be alternative condensed and aligned with Win style of controls that we can use to create applications that are looking just like their classical counterparts while benefitting from UWP improvements ,1
6745,3140, I belive that Store should control the SDK level more grained ,1
6746,3143, Please add background to TextBlock control ,1
6747,3150, Please integrate ffmpeg or vlc libraries by default in these xaml elements to make it easier for developers to build apps that run all kinds of video and audio files ,1
6748,3152, It would be nice to be able to assign a compiled binding to properties through the VisualState Setters of XamlBehaviors ,1
6749,3174, Please add a delegate version for the PropertyMetadata Create where the DependencyProperty is supplied so you can create a default value for the dependency object instead of a simple default value ,1
6750,3193, Please bring all languages to Cortana for IoT because are needed to create devices for interacting people from around the world ,1
6751,3196, Provide semantic animations like fadeIn fadeout Crossfade etc ,1
6752,3199, Should also do this for other converters for same behavior ,1
6753,3238, If white background scrollbar should be a different color so it is fully visible ,1
6754,3273, It could be really good to hot reload the app when changing C # or XAML code ,1
6755,3276, It would be great to add a property to choose the direction of the progress bar clockwise or counterclockwise ,1
6756,3277, When notifications are removed from one device they should be removed from all devices by default ,1
6757,3285, I know there are no plans for running UWP apps in Windows but a designer would be nice and would virtually remove the need to upgrade to Windows before writing apps for it ,1
6758,3288, Aside from my personal dilemma of a missing device it would definitely make sense to be able testing code in an emulator first instead of having lots of hardware around all the time ,1
6759,3295, If Microsoft fears somebody could use the emulator for playing games on a computer then just turn off games ,1
6760,3313, Please create ActualStartLocation in FileOpenPicker so that we can open the file selection dialog into the exact folder we want ,1
6761,3320, Please add an API that allows to read the temperature from the device example ,1
6762,3349, Please add the ability to access the rendering pipeline to the MapControl class ,1
6763,3359, It would be great if the Application Executable launcher exe element or the uap Extension Category windows appExecutionAlias element would allow me to specify arguments in the AppxManifest xml file ,1
6764,3362, So why not include EnablePullToRefresh as a property of MasterDetailsView ,1
6765,3365, It would make developers life much easier if they had a possibility to access files simpler ,1
6766,3387, So my opinion is to create two new controls ,1
6767,3388, One is TextCanvas for Display and Editing both Text and Inking ,1
6768,3407, It would be great if the Roaming Folder Quota was larger than KB MB at least this would prevent us from having to depend on a network paid service to have great cross device customer experiences ,1
6769,3408, This is not really completely UWP related but Microsoft should provide free virtual machines of all Windows versions for testing purposes as in my experience UWP is really fragile and could make my app behave differently in every version ,1
6770,3413, Do you think that you could make the Windows Store and other built in apps accessible from the device portal making it a lot easier to install new apps that are already on the store and make changes in settings etc ,1
6771,3429, It would be great if something similar to DependencyObject SetCurrentValue method from WPF would be introduced in the future so that a DependencyProperty can be set to a new value without missing an one way binding ,1
6772,3436, Can you please expose the Viseme events for the windows speech sythesis ,1
6773,3440, I think it would be useful to have in the toolkit ,1
6774,3442, it would be great to be able to bind invoke scripts inside a WebView from a ViewModel like binding a URL to a Property ,1
6775,3448, Symbol Enum should be updated with latest Segoe MDL asset collections ,1
6776,3459, If the enumeration are updated with the latest MDL glyphs it may helps many of developers who search the correct glyphs ,1
6777,3493, Could you please add SelectRanges IEnumerabel ItemIndexRange itemIndexRanges to be able to add multiple ranges at once and also make SelectedRanges property is only get set to be able to replace existing selection ranges ,1
6778,3496, After releasing to refresh the list should animate back to top as a simple list do and while awaitng for the data to be fetched the Refresh indicator content should be visible or have a property to control it is visibility i would prefer this one ,1
6779,3506, It would be even better if I could have an API that could make the calculations for me and offer up a packet failure retransmission percent or average time between send and acknowledgment ,1
6780,3512, Optionally the worker side of async awaitable should accept notification URI in conjunction with Type which the Type itself may or may not exist on the target of execution in which case it can decide to create exception instance or return typical HTTP message the important part is the contract of return notification should be extended to the application developer in a way that allows to harvest it is result in an expected format potentially by polling yet another resource ,1
6781,3522, But either way please do make an API available ,1
6782,3561, Providing thos apps would boost UWp as platform and thus create more possibilities for Users and Developers together ,1
6783,3568, Please allow private developers to access those capabilities ,1
6784,3585, I hope everyone can publish fonts on the store ,1
6785,3586, It would be good for developers to specify auto renewal of the durable paid add ons in Developer portal so users do not need to repurchase the add on again and again ,1
6786,3598, A toolbar stacks items from left to right and it would be great to have such a toolbar in UWP like we have it today in WPF and several other desktop programming models ,1
6787,3602, If you build it it would be great if you could add configurable close functionality to the tab header that is bindable to a ViewModel ,1
6788,3609, I think this could be made simpler by support for example a HeaderStyle Property on the Pivot ,1
6789,3613, Maybe the dev should be able to define the panel used for the headers ,1
6790,3620, For a classic desktop application we need a TabControl ,1
6791,3632, So I suggest that you bring the HierarchicalDataTemplate to UWP ,1
6792,3635, Please increase the limit way up or remove it completley ,1
6793,3641, If you add files from across the filesytem which I do in my app letting the user drop in images and videos from any location you could rapidly hit the files limit ,1
6794,3661, Increase FutureAccessList limit like in millions ,1
6795,3662, Introduce Userchoice Dialog if AccessException is raised ,1
6796,3663, Also as a secondary request let FolderPicker SuggestedStartLocation also be a FolderRelativeId ,1
6797,3666, Optional show an user input dialog requesting access to the file or folder and let the user decide ,1
6798,3713, Please add a trigger to start a background task when a nearby NFC tag is recognized ,1
6799,3717, It would be more convenient for the user if my app could react on the NFC tag even when the phone is locked ,1
6800,3724, Add system tray support so that app can be minimised to system tray ,1
6801,3728, You need to provide CoreWindow Minimise api in this case ,1
6802,3729, Allow other formats than computerM and float for a FrameOutputNode created with CreateFrameOutputNode of class AudioGraph ,1
6803,3735, This burden would be eliminated would MP Frames be available by the FrameOutputNode ,1
6804,3737, Other Formats like MP or OGG would be nice ,1
6805,3745, It must be possible to only unload Main UI out of the process without terminating the app service ,1
6806,3746, Allow changing of volume in the Windows Device Portal ,1
6807,3749, Please add the old Silverlight Pivot Control to UWP toolkit ,1
6808,3769, Can you please add an IAP which would have a recurring payment automatically charge user monthly annually etc ,1
6809,3780, I would like to add a function that automatically loads the lyrics to the song that is played right now ,1
6810,3781, To solve that it would be enough to have read access to the System Media Transport Controls data of other apps ,1
6811,3787, It could be interesting to provide a control to generate and show a Power BI chart inside a UWP application easily with a Control or by code ,1
6812,3801, It would be useful for creating more user friendly battery related apps that provide better experience for example by refreshing tile or sending notification on the event not some time after it happened ,1
6813,3803, We can also change lock screen background ,1
6814,3804, However it would be useful to get more flexibility ,1
6815,3807, If we could put some templated or custom notifications it would save us a lot of work and make lock screen more user friendly ,1
6816,3814, Provide more rich API for text rendering without need to use low level Direct D for rich text rendering capabilities ,1
6817,3829, I would also be happy if MapTileSource property changes like Bounds were applied to the map without need to remove the tile source and add it back this is how it can be done currently ,1
6818,3842, Compare the UI usage with Google Chrome for example ,1
6819,3858, Maybe by default the way it looks now but it should have a slider that is magnified if the user taps close to edge of the list and signals it is intention to use more ,1
6820,3889, There is should be a way to include secure data as strings or byte remotely at dev center as app setting ,1
6821,3894, There is should be way to revoke secure data on server which would require re publishing app with new set of keys and app with revoked keys should fail on access to secure storage ,1
6822,3898, This data should be accessible from secure key storage immediately after app install and keys should be installed into secure key storage as part of app installation process ,1
6823,3947, Provide ability to deploy an update to certain users only ,1
6824,3950, It would really be great if there was a control which allows to move forward an backward like the Microsoft Edge Browser does with touch input or touchpad input ,1
6825,3951, It should work like a horizontal ListView or GridView so you can normally scroll through the listed items but when you hit the end of the list and continue scrolling the edge like part should kick in and navigate you to new or old View Page List ,1
6826,3953, I would love a control that would be a sibling to ListView or GridView only it was backed by a D Canvas instead of an ItemsStackPanel ,1
6827,3955, Allow the placement of rectangular items in D ,1
6828,3957, An optional bonus would be to allow the user to rotate the items ,1
6829,3959, The look and content of the items should of course be customizable ,1
6830,3960, It would be extremely helpful to be able to create MediaSourceStreams for audio streams in the Vorbis and or Opus formats ,1
6831,3995, DockPanel should be ported to Windows XAML ,1
6832,3998, Currently store access from windows is either enabled or disabled this really needs to be more granular ie ,1
6833,4000, Should be clear nullable properties in XAML should be supported and not give the error Cannot assign to nullable type on property ,1
6834,4012, Please check and fix this bug as it is causing frustration to Xbox users ,1
6835,4021, For me personally it would be much more convenient to be able to enter my privacy policy content directly into a text field when submitting updating my app rather than having to provide a URL so I think this should be an option ,1
6836,4032, Allow us to use runtime arguments for Windows ApplicationModel FullTrustProcessLauncher LaunchFullTrustProcessForCurrentAppAsync in addition to the parameters declared in the manifest ,1
6837,4036, In short you could add something like this in your manifest file ,1
6838,4040, In my case I would also be happy if it was possible to add verbs on all file types but this is something I could live without emhappy ,1
6839,4051, Merging them into a single installer would benefit our users greatly ,1
6840,4052, It seems in order to do that we need to either pull out of the store or convert our desktop app to a uwp and merge the two installers ,1
6841,4086, It would be great if we have an option in disabling the overpanning behavior in ScrollViewer with an API or with any other option to disable it ,1
6842,4090, Net standard should be used by UWP and not limited by it ,1
6843,4094, Because only simple values are supposed to be used as navigation parameters this suggests that a third party software component must exist for managing the sharing of complex objects between pages ,1
6844,4103, Evidently this is a limitation of the MediaComposition SaveAsync API it should be fixed ,1
6845,4130, If FM radio APIs are brought in it would be amazing if we could get RDS support as well ,1
6846,4135, I believe this should be a user based permission API in case the user does not want me to have this ability ,1
6847,4138, I would greatly apperciate if these APIs could be added to UWP ,1
6848,4144, It would be fantastic if it could be possible to access such data from the converted classic apps ,1
6849,4165, If my app is currently playing audio it would be nice if my app could control the experience and interact how i would want it to outside of the system experience ,1
6850,4167, I would like to control have my app control the vibration haptic feedback setting ,1
6851,4170, just imagine connecting your phone to a display device and building UWP apps on it it can be the next big thing for developers because no developer wants to carry a kg laptop wherever he goes ,1
6852,4198, It would be cool to have a option to remove the border and caption of the window so we can make non rectangular windows just like with GDI and the Layered Windows API ,1
6853,4202, Please expose the DirectX COM API as UWP one having the API coming from Microsoft would be a much better guarantee than relying on third partys or in house wrappers ,1
6854,4209, Subscribers of the BackRequested event should be notified in stack order instead of queue order ,1
6855,4211, Example In the UWP Community Toolkit the MasterDetailsView control needs to listen to the back requested event to handle navigating back when in a collapsed state with selection ,1
6856,4217, it would be great if user and dev could modify alarm volume ,1
6857,4220, The best it would be if also dev could set volume granularly on each Toast notification ,1
6858,4221, User might want lower volume for morning alarms and louder volume for alarm used during busy day ,1
6859,4227, Let the user choose between spit screen or Anaglyph Red Cyan ,1
6860,4231, The only workaround so far is to write the text in a Win WPF application and then Copy Paste the text into the appropriate fields which causes a serious security problem when working with critical passwords ,1

6869,4270, Music app can provide to it is users an extended network functionality such as audio streaming UPnP DLNA or SMB CIFS or FTP client to get music files from server UPnP DLNA client to send audio data to renderer UPnP DLNA media server or renderer ,1
6870,4274, It would be useful to have either backgroundNetwork new capability or atleast extend backgroundMediaPlayback capability and if playback is active which can possibly be using network communication and app is not suspended keep network communication active ,1
6871,4285, The only option for now would be to make a separate ' Pro ' app ,1
6872,4288, Please add an Azure Developer VM for Windows with Unity ,1
6873,4295, The Playback Devices and Recording Devices section should be merged and more info like samplerate channelcount and meters for every input and output should be added with a better UI ,1
6874,4296, It should also be possible to easily select the device where you want to play your system sounds but also to select two channels of a multichannel device if you need your average stereo output for most applications ,1
6875,4309, Therefore it would be nice to have an option like XsltSettings EnableDocumentFunction Property in NET apps ,1

6888,4529, Please add few enhancements so it accepts HTML also or add a converter which may help developers ,1
6889,4538, I suggest making this data more accessible so that servers can be better monitored both to track failures and to inform a cloud system it needs to scale out to more servers ,1
6890,4539, New HTTP Server and HttpListener APIs should be added that surface the failures and request queue state ,1
6891,4552, It would be great to add new status like closed or abandoned ,1
6892,4560, Please set a limit and if you are going to ask for a description make it at least or characters long ,1
6893,4569, Windows should allow users to freely redirect media Audio MIDI even Video someday I guess from to the Hardware audio interface webcam etc and or Applications even considering The Desktop as a video audio media generator ,1
6894,4573, It could be as simplistic as allowing piping Apps Devices outputs into Apps Devices inputs through virtual interfaces managed by the user through a piping routing manager GUI ,1
6895,4603, There should be a native way for developers to omit their app from being able to show a preview when hovered over in the taskbar as well as preventing the screenshot that is visible in the recent apps section on mobile ,1
6896,4612, We are aware of the risk of allowing an app to hide itself from the system but it would be beneficial for security software to have a means of controlling any data that may need to be hidden ,1
6897,4630, At this point I think it might be best to just lift the restriction of insider reviews and also show more reviews regardless of version ,1
6898,4632, At the very least do not delete reviews from the dev center even if they are not displayed in the store so we can use them for marketing etc ,1
6899,4639, Why dont we support AdjacentToTopDisplayEdge and AdjacentToBottomDisplayEdge too ,1
6900,4654, Make it possible to add the EnvironmentPermission node in the Package appxmanifest to allow Environment variables to be retrieved ,1

6905,4723, Add a UserNotificationChangedTriggerDetails to UserNotificationChangedTrigger background task with at least ,1
6906,4745, My suggestion is to change the behavior of that triggers or add another pair which will fire on Lock Unlock transitions ,1
6907,4768, This behavior should be fixed or a new property should be made available in the SDK to enable us to get the user defined settings for regional format ,1
6908,4770, We need a way to have a system wide overlay notification ,1
6909,4774, This could be used in the new Skype Preview app and would be EXTREMLY awesome and powerful ,1

6915,4842, Use file playback sample or custom effects sample ,1
6916,4878, And for the consistency of the UI design sometimes it will be nice to allow the app freely styling the buttonsespecially the close button ,1
6917,4880, For example developers can hide those built in buttons and draw their own ones and call CoreWindow Minimize CoreWindow Maximize etc ,1
6918,4885, Looking forward to customizable window chrome for UWP apps ,1
6919,4895, An example is in VS I have files copied in during a build process and would like the ability to write against the ,1

6934,5083, Please provide a template for emsad XAML interop ,1
6935,5098, Once a StorageFile or StorageFolder is allowed to be accessed by the user it SHOULD BE accessible across all those different API ,1
6936,5100, It would be nice to have a command line tool to submit apps to the store ,1

6944,5183, Camera should work when app is minimized ,1
6945,2902, The idea is to segregate the User Interface and business logic such that the user interface will execute on users machine outside of browser chrome as a standalone application ,1
6946,2925, Make it easier to register for a background task ,1
6947,3146, There are a lot of upcoming features to help with Fluent design and they are really great however to make full use of these the features xaml controls need to be backward compatible or do a fallback so that apps that do not target only the latest can also use this ,1
6948,3189, Please review your Package scanning portion of the application ,1
6949,3278, Developers should have the option to opt out instead of the option to opt in ,1

6954,3412, All I am asking is when a new version of Windows is released please keep the old VMs still in there ,1
6955,3456, In fact we can use xE D Share with FontIcon element without the enumeration ,1
6956,3505, It would be really cool if I could open a TCP IP socket and by listening to the raw transmissions and re send events determine how good the network quality is ,1
6957,3511, The other side of the task should not even expect to notify someone of it is progress unless the platform offers capabilities such as SQL Server X Event Windows Application Event Log or some form of notification ,1
6958,3534, It would also be good for tracking the causes of uninstall spikes etc ,1
6959,3554, It would be nice if for adaptive tiles with multiple groups where the current size can not fit all the groups those groups would automatically cycle around similar to MSN news live tile or calendar app but in this case an individual notification would be cycling rather than a queue of separate notifications ,1
6960,3587, Also it would be great to have the option for paid apps to be a subscription so users are charged periodically to continue using the app ,1
6961,3591, Some apps could benefit from an easy way to not only send a toast notification but also maintain a notification history users could view afterwards ,1
6962,3615, Implicit DataTemplates not really an issue of the Pivot but would be great to have these ,1
6963,3687, A control similar to the FlowDocumentReader FlowDocumentScrollViewer would be really awesome ,1
6964,3702, I have had to take ads out of my app to make it run and stop users complaining but now that means no income until this is fixed ,0
6965,3752, The control is the equivalent of a pivot table in excel you simply add the datasets with labels and the control sorts out all the selection fields visualizations and animations ,0
6966,3784, Please expose Undo Redo functions on the TextBox control so that we can trigger it programatically ,1
6967,3789, If would like to offer some guides to the user in our own application it could be interesting to have some interesting to be able to show a Popup that give user some indication in the app in a precise scenario like when discovering a page the first time or when a new feature has been delivered ,1
6968,3793, Allow to mix two app models JavaScript WinJS HTML and C # XAML inside one application ,1
6969,3795, Make scroll viewers and lists support gestures to scroll to bottom or to top at once ,1
6970,3838, So if a menu is displayed and the user moves the mouse over another menu without clicking the first menu would close and the new one hovered over would open ,0
6971,3878, In fact I wonder why MS does not support this FUNDAMENTAL feature while Android and iOS already does ,0
6972,3902, If you create a ListView in an HTML UWP app you can not invoke an item after scolling trough it with your touchscreen ,0
6973,3955, Allow the placement of rectangular items in D ,1
6974,3962, Make AutoSuggestBox supports AutomationProperties for test automations and accessibility ,1
6975,3998, Currently store access from windows is either enabled or disabled this really needs to be more granular ,1
6976,4007, I think that app should have two ratings one from Windows Phone users visible to people having Windows Phone and second one from Windows Mobile users visible to Windows users ,1
6977,4030, In the appxmanifest one can only specify the default colors or a hex value ,0
6978,4031, There should be an option to enter accent to let the default splashscreen have the users accent color ,1

6982,4164, I would like to programmatically set and get the volume for Windows ,1
6983,4168, With Windows Mobile UWP and Continuum Microsoft is focusing on enterprise customers and developers so I think bringing VS to windows mobile through continuum can be game changer ,1
6984,4246, So that in theory our applications could report and find bugs for us ,0
6985,4303, It should also be possible to easily select the device where you want to play your system sounds but also to select two channels ,1
6986,4360, Using the CreateRequestAsync method of UserCertificateEnrollmentManager and CertificateEnrollmentManager classes I noticed that the CertificatePropertiesCollection does not give us the capability of specifying enhanced key usage OIDs for example SmartCard Logon Secure E Mail basic constraints like Subject Type End Entity or Path Length Constraint none nor the Subject Alternative Name like RFC DS Object Guid ect ,0
6987,4429, I hope you will take this suggestion in consideration since this feature will be very useful and easy to implement by applications developers ,0
6988,4430, Of course it would be even better to make xaml use TypeConverter additionally for compatibility is sake with WPF ,1
6989,4435, I already know workarounds using Bindings but they are not practical they need more code and they are semantically incorrect a binding is not a transcoding conversion they are different by nature ,0
6990,4457, This gives you low latency input in case of a busy UI thread ,0
6991,4499, I think Microsoft needs OR boost XAML development OR if it does not interest it open source it then the community can itself improve it ,1
6992,4505, Please revise that value to px or provide better representation solution ,1
6993,4581, Any media Audio MIDI Video generator consumer be it an app or an hardware device should be treated as a freely connectable node instead of an hardwired starting ending point like today ,1
6994,4660, The documentation indicates that it should be possible to provide an EnvironmentPermission for this to work but out of the box running this code in a UWP project never throws any of the listed exceptions if you do not specify the EnvironmentPermission ,0
6995,4671, Simple usage of the DNS SD API results in the DNS Client service crashing ,0
6996,4720, Extremely need password protected zipping and unzipping for universal app ,1

7106,6556, If all variations could be merged I think most developers would be able to adjust to it and there would be less confusion in the future ,1

7153,458, This package contains our code compiled with the native tool chain ,0
7154,463,This package does always crash after side loading it ,0
7155,464,So this crash is not the problem reported by the certification process ,0
7156,465,Now things are very complicated ,0

7167,479, Entry point for FormatMessage not found After some searching I found this url and yes I was using this library with the old version ,0

7169,483,But why was it working on my local machine ,0
7170,484,This is because I am using Visual Studio which has already fixed the problem ,0
7171,485,Unfortunately the build infrastructure of Microsoft which is used for the UWP certification process at least for our targeted OS version Windows falls creators update uses the buggy version of the SupportedAPIs x ,0
7172,487,After I used the latest version of PInvoke Kernel dll which contains a workaround for the problem all was fine ,0

7239,661,I was actually excited to see it was built into the Nav control because i can not figure out where to place the backbutton either such that it doesn t look weird and out of place but the built in nav backbutton does not solve the problem either it still look weird and extreme beta ,0
7240,662,Currently there is a set of COM APIs that provide access to Virtual Desktop related features like pinning apps to desktops switching desktops etc ,0
7241,663,Unfortunately most of it is undocumented and does not seem to be stabilized Spring Update for instance changed IApplicationView is CLSID so apps using it stopped working ,0
7242,670,The store listings are not editable for all my applications ,0

7246,674, the one used in dotnet core applications,0
7247,675,Windows is the only platform that does not support this natively ,0
7248,676,Even the iPhone has had this for almost eight years ,0
7249,677,I have been experiencing tons of system crashes recently so I disabling my third party loopback driver to see if it helps but this means I lose this functionality ,0
7250,678,Not having these APIs means I cannot as a developer make an app that uses the Surface touch screen to control music software ,0
7251,680,Android and iOS have popular apps that do this ,0
7252,681,Raspberry Pi and Arduino have countless MIDI projects on GitHub ,0
7253,682,Windows is literally the only platform that restricts musicians in this way ,0
7254,690,Raspberry Pi and Arduino have countless MIDI projects on more,0
7255,692,DataPackage OperationCompleted is not raised at least when pasting text ,0
7256,693,This is contrary to the docs and to expected behavior ,0
7257,694, It is does with Html but not with Text ,0

7261,703,Up until the latest windows update the virtual keyboard worked fine but now using my app with the most recent nuget packages in assigned access mode tablet mode the keyboard closes when tapping a different inputbox on a xaml form ,0
7262,704,To get the keyboard to return you have to tap it again and this happens on every single box ,0
7263,705,It did not do this before the latest update ,0

7269,717,I can see it relative with USBXHCI But I have no idea ,0
7270,718,Often the same command is available in an app through different ways ,0
7271,719,It might be placed in a MenuFlyout in a Button in a AppBarButton ,0
7272,721,The problem is that all these controls have different properties for the text content ,0
7273,722,All with the same original and translated text for all languages ,0
7274,723,It is pretty annoying having to duplicate lots or resources just becase the same command has now moved to a different control ,0
7275,734,Currently you cannot create an Emitter unless you are using K Wave audio ,0
7276,735,Back in DirectSound you could do L R panning with any Wave sample rate ,0
7277,736,One of the benefits of migrating to AudioGraph is support for mp other files but if you want do panning you still have to convert them first ,0
7278,740,I am looking after a solution already over a decade for D mouses working over Windows Remote Desktop Connection ,0
7279,741,Still today D mouses USB connected to the local computer and used over a remote desktop connection to external server are not working properly ,0
7280,742,On the field there are hundreds of CAD industrial designers and other engineers still not able to use a D mouse on the remote server over Microsoft RDC ,0
7281,743,Normal mouses are working fine but D mouse such a SpaceNavigator from D Connexion is only able to zoom over RDC ,0
7282,745,Other competitors such as Citrix and HP have already solved this issue with their own Remote Desktop clients ,0
7283,756,Would still keep the Instance property to prevent breaking changes,0
7284,758,App language is English FlowDirection LTR ,0
7285,759,Swiping a SwipeControl item from the right to the left will reveal the options on the right as if dragging the item to the left revealing options behind it ,0
7286,761,User changes the language to Arabic FlowDirection RTL ,0
7287,762,Expectation User swipes from the left to the right to reveal the options on the left as if dragging the item to the right to reveal options behind it ,0
7288,763,Currently user swipes from the right to the left to reveal the options on the left as if the item is moving in the opposite direction of the dragging motion ,0
7289,773,Developers will pass in a UPN email which will bypass the initial Realm Discovery Dialog thereby reducing the number of dialogs the user sees during login to the graph ,0

7291,775,It is working great on physical machines ,0
7292,776,But on virtual machines we get a InvalidCastException ,0
7293,777,It is happening on multiple different virtualizers Parallels VirtualBox ,0
7294,778,Here is a small testing UWP app ,0
7295,779,I have also posted the full exception there ,0
7296,780,Transferring large amounts of data kB takes way to long when transferred via BLE using native windows functionality as the min connection interval seems to be quite large ,0
7297,781,Using an BLE Dongle via HCI where it is ,0
7298,782,possible to set the min conncetion interval the transfer duration of the same data is approximately four times lower than with native BLE ,0
7299,784,Not able to retrieve MAC address of device ,0
7300,788,Without a Header Attribute for the Button Control it looks like and does not line up ,0
7301,791,That would be sort of like going to Starbucks and telling the casher person to leaving room for Cream in your Coffee where the cream layer is for your Headers ,0
7302,792,The reason why Button needs a Header Attribute is because if I make a grid of a TextBox with Header Field set and a place a button next to it it looks likes like without the header padding to push the button down ,0
7303,797,In the case where no bing maps data is being used example ,0
7304,799,Ideally some way to disable the bing maps access explicitly plus some smart watermark ie ms resolution ,0
7305,807,I believe there is progress coming way for this issue already but I want to post it just to show my desire for it ,0
7306,808,I am attempting to use lsof to find an open port for an application but rather it returns sock can not identify protocol ,0
7307,809,This occurs because proc net tcp is empty and thus the socket cannot be identified as TCP ,0
7308,811,I selected a set of rd party drivers and my computer immediately failed to boot ,0
7309,812,Now I have a painful regime of monkey motion to go through to test them one by one even with binary search it is going to be painful ,0
7310,814,Thanks in advance for considering this ,0
7311,815,The new WinRT MIDI APIs are broken and have been since their introduction with no sign of plans to be fixed ,0
7312,816,In addition the functionality they provide is still lacking compared to other platforms ,0
7313,817,There is information on this in the other MIDI topics on this page and on GitHub if you do an issue search for winrt midi or uwp midi ,0
7314,819,Delete all Universal Windows Platform,0
7315,820,There is no way to get battery usage of system display Wifi Mobile Data etc ,0
7316,821,But this details are available in BATTERY USE settings,0
7317,823,Currently it only supports touch input ,0
7318,824,I appreciate that swipe controls have come out of developments around touch interfaces ,0
7319,826,Microsoft have set precedent for this in their own apps ,0
7320,827,Outlook for example utilises a SwipeControl type arrangement that can be interacted with using a mouse for marking emails as read or unread among other things ,0
7321,836,And I have a problem with windows explorer that it breaks every time when I try to move from one screen to another ,0
7322,837,I just figured out what was the problem and I can work with it without any problem but I want to post it to see if it can be fixed for another user ,0
7323,838,How to emulate the bug,0
7324,842, Now with the mouse pointer click on the title of the window and move it to the second screen ,0
7325,843,the problem that I get is that the window will flash and crash the solution is to close it in the taskbar restart the explorer process ,0
7326,845,Then when you move the screen it will not have the same problem ,0
7327,846,I have a Windows notebook with a second screen ,0
7328,850, Open windows explorer ,0

7334,875,Each time I sit down the display setting for the external screen is to clone but I want it to be extended ,0
7335,876,My Customer I am an Office Consultant are struggling with the adoption of this new way of working because of simple things like this that annoy and takes minutes per person per working spot ,0
7336,878,The following example does not show an error in the Designer but throws errors in the generated code ,0
7337,883,The above case is trying to subtract from the width of another element but clamp it within a specific range ,0
7338,892,Currently it seems to be sorted by Unicode code points which does not make any sense for Chinese characters at least ,0
7339,893,I have a disk imaging application which I have already converted that writes bytes directly to disk USB and SD cards ,0
7340,894,It requires admin rights to get a lock on the disk ,0
7341,897,There are thousands of apps out there that probably are not converted for similar reasons ,0
7342,902,Test apps although hidden in the store undergo the same certification process ,0
7343,905,The submission process for test apps takes too long ,0
7344,910,I have been trying to get my son into programming and so far his dev experience has been less than exciting ,0
7345,911,He wants to debug his game real time but the emulator is a pain to deal with forces and gps etc ,0
7346,912,Allegedly this works however I have found thread after thread of people looking for a real solution but no one appears to make any headway because VS gives useless feedback ,0
7347,913,I have spent an entire day trying to get something anything working ,0
7348,914,if I choose device I get a generic error vie tried every suggestion I can find online if I choose remote machine I am prompted for a pin so I go into the for devs page on my device and I hit pair and I get a digit pin ,0
7349,915,that pin does not work though so the pin screen wont go away ,0
7350,916,I was able to finally build an app package that I can manually move o the device in the portal but I should not have to do that and it breaks the debug chain ,0
7351,922,The link to the PrinterExtensionLibrary for UWP points to ,0

7356,935,I have noticed that sometimes the microphone function on the iPhone and Android app tends to stall or freeze ,0
7357,936,It does not matter if I set the microphone to open upon application launch or activate the microphone the delay in time the user has to wait to speak to Cortana is quite noticeable ,0
7358,938,I understand the limitations of Apple so it is unlikely the user will be able to respond to a text message directly on a Windows computer ,0
7359,947,For example when I want to go to my user path just Ctrl R enter then press Enter ,0

7365,958,I have a driver causing a memory leak ,0
7366,960,Poolmon is not offered as a standalone tool and only as part of the Windows Driver Kit so I must download the entire Windows Driver Kit to access this one small tool ,0
7367,961,In order to download the Windows Driver Kit I must first install Visual Studio ,0
7368,962,I am not going to download multiple GBs of that I will never use to fix a memory leak ,0
7369,963,That just turns my memory leak issue into a hard drive bloat issue ,0
7370,965,Thanks for nothing Microsoft ,0
7371,967,Microsoft is official support reccomends that I use a tool called poolmon to find which driver is causing the leak ,0
7372,974,Scenario An application saving different file formats with the same file extension example choices for TXT files when saving with Excel MS Office ,0
7373,975,Case tested When using FileSavePicker with UWP even if the application adds different choices with the same file extension then it is not possible to know which of those choices the user actually selected ,0
7374,976,FileSavePicker just returns a StorageFile class for the file name and extension ,0
7375,977,Issue I developed a Desktop application saving files with different formats with the same file extension using SaveFileDialog and FilterIndex and currently UWP would not allow me to convert the application from Desktop without adding additional menu options or dialogs so the user can chose what he she wants ,0
7376,978,This means adding more steps to select something that is already shown on the FileSavePicker dialog which I think it would eventually affect in a way the user experience ,0
7377,980, Scenario An application saving different file formats with the same file extension example choices for TXT files when saving with Excel MS Office ,0
7378,981, Case tested When using FileSavePicker with UWP even if the application adds different choices with the same file extension then it is not possible to know which of those choices the user actually selected ,0

7380,984,You know it for sure one developer produces great software like Google Chrome Paint net or many others ,0
7381,985,The other developers try to force customers to use their software for example M dollar with Edge and Paint D ,0
7382,986,M dollar even tries to pay customers to use Bing Edge ,0
7383,990,If necessary you could send your incompetent product managers to the competitors at least at school so the can learn how great Software has to feel and look like ,0
7384,992,M dollar just displays lines ,0
7385,993,It feels like M dollar is begging the customers to send no feedback because M dollar hates it but must do something ,0
7386,1000,This is the crezy idea ,0
7387,1001,M dollar could try again to develop great software again as many years before which your customers want to install themselves because it is just fun to work with and it brings great benefits to users ,0
7388,1007,How about letting the user decide whether My People should use these animated notifications or normal Toasts ,1
7389,1009,I am missing the ability to change the font name size and color ,0

7394,1019,I understand that cloudbooks are meant to largely be web based tools ,0
7395,1020,But there are still times when you want to install some things ,0
7396,1021,I also understand that this will be something that software manufacturers will be requesting to MS directly ,0
7397,1033,With F # still not providing a way to code a full application for the desktop using UWP after several years of people waiting I want to call for bringing Common Lisp to the platform ,0
7398,1035,Machines now have the power to really make Lisp shine and show all it can do to empower UWP developers to create amazing solutions ,0
7399,1040,The users that are already subscribed to the Add on will keep the same price as before but the new Users will get the new price ,0
7400,1041,What is the reason that currently Microsoft is blocking a price increase ,0
7401,1042,It is not really convenient for developers to create every time a new Add on when they want to increase the price ,0
7402,1043,We tried to embrace Microsoft is vision for UWP but failed misreably wasting lots of time and money ,0
7403,1044,We built a UWP application that reads public data off ISO smart cards successfully until we realized that the app fails to function in release mode ,0
7404,1045,In debug mode it all works fine ,0
7405,1046,In release mode we generate the appx and it passes windows certification ,0
7406,1047,The smartcard functionality however which is based on a net standard library fails to work url ,0
7407,1048,We are now trying to use the native UWP SmartCard API but it is largely useless as we cannot find any methods to construct and transmit APDyou which are the basic communication block,0
7408,1050,For now we have no option but to re build the app to a non Microsoft environment ,0
7409,1057,The wireless card worked well till windows ,0
7410,1058,Now this is a mess ,0
7411,1059,Intel says they cannot Give update ,0

7426,1103,Please do not reply me with this url ,0

7431,1116,Both Process Isolation and Hyper V Isolation for Containers are available in Windows Server but Windows only supports Hyper V isolation ,0
7432,1117,Hyper V isolation has benefits but also has many drawbacks such as resource allocation performance as well as stability ,0
7433,1118,A simple check of the Docker for Windows issues board url shows a large imbalance of Windows and Hyper V isolation related issued where the Windows Server issues are much less common ,0

7435,1126,MmSecureVirtualMemoryAgainstWrites seems to do the job but it is undocumented and not even exported ,0
7436,1127,In my enterprise application basically a sales and purchase application ,0
7437,1128,Currently UWP allow RenderTargetBitmap API to render framework element in xaml to image which currently in viewed in screen ,0
7438,1129,But in my case i want to print receipt and do not want to show the receipt in the screen and just pass the bitmap image of receipt to POS Printer ,0
7439,1130,But RenderTargetBitmap API does not work in Background ,0
7440,1136,In UWP XAML binding something that is NOT an ICommand to an event gives an exception in the XAML compiler WCM Object Reference not set to an instance of an object ,0
7441,1139,I would expect it to catch this an give a readable error message about an invalid binding idealy the propertyname and the control type at least ,0
7442,1140,Something that lets you investigate ,0
7443,1141,Using Microsoft gift cards as developer account registration fee ,0
7444,1142,well it is really powerful for indie devs,0
7445,1143,Let us say there is a app which display news stories ,0
7446,1144,The app does not want to have too many stories on the screen and load stories on demand ,0
7447,1145,The first time the app is opened it downloads news article and display is say the top to user in a ListView and rest are stored locally ,0
7448,1146,These are displayed if the user scrolls down Incremental Loading Collection Helpers are great addition ,0
7449,1147,Now let us say next day the app is opened again ,0
7450,1148,App immediately displays yesterday is news stories and works in background to load new stories or user pulls to refresh ,0
7451,1149,As soon as new stories are downloaded they are added at the from of the ListView not all but say top and rest goes to the disk cache ,0
7452,1150,Now if user scrolls down more stories are fetched from the cache disk ,0
7453,1162,on Windows UWP apps if you rapidly click or unintentionally double click on any control supporting click tapped event it is associated Click event handler will execute for each ,0
7454,1163,This can cause a lot of unintended side effects ,0
7455,1164,For example if the Click event handler brings up a modal ContentDialog with the ShowAsync command an additional click will cause the event handler to fire again before modal isolation occurs and create another ContentDialog which causes an exception if not handled will result in a crash of the application ,0
7456,1167,Tablet Version Microsoft Windows version ,0
7457,1171,Target version Windows Build ,0
7458,1179,It used to do this in Windows and early Windows versions but this apparently changed a while ago ,0
7459,1184,This will be a good addition ,0
7460,1186,It is understandable that when UWP app is run normally it can only access a limited set of COM objects however if the UWP is packaged to desktop bridge it makes sense to allow it to access additional COM objects exposed by that desktop bridge using the technical described in the blog above ,0
7461,1187,Without this support if a desktop bridge contains a UWP app and a win app exposes out of proc COM objects the only way UWP app can communicate with the win app is through AppService ,0
7462,1188,This brings a lot of overhead and unnecessary work to add AppService into win app and sometimes it is impossible if win source code is not available ,0
7463,1190,Packaged COM url allows exposing out of proc COM objects using desktop bridge however these COM objects are not accessible from UWP apps even if the UWP apps are packaged into same desktop bridge exposes the COM objects ,0
7464,1194,We are a dev house that specialises in publishing dedicated Xbox Apps ,0
7465,1195,It used to be that there was a really high standard to get certified on Xbox which was tough to get through but at least the standard of apps was pretty high ,0
7466,1196,Now it seems there is zero standard to be certified to publish an app on Xbox and by default EVERY windows app that is published is published on all devices ,0
7467,1197,I know microsoft is trying to flesh out the app stores on each device but it means that when we publish an app now our app is barely out a day and it is pushed way down the new apps list making it almost impossible to generate organic downloads from curious users ,0
7468,1198,That is fine if we are being kept out by other Xbox apps but we released an app last week and currently there are about dozens apps ahead of us half that will not even work on an Xbox with a controller ,0
7469,1199,It is totally crazy and really counterproductive to building any kind of a vibrant ecosystem ,0
7470,1200,One simple example is there is a PDF database app on the new apps list on XBOX ,0
7471,1201,You cannot use it it cannot access files and it has absolutely no viable function on Xbox One ,0
7472,1202,Yet somehow this passes certification and is thrown on the pile of rubbish that now clutters the new app section ,0
7473,1204,It is hugely frustrating to put months of work into building an app for xbox and stand no chance of getting it downloaded because nobody will ever be able to find it ,0
7474,1209,I know microsoft is trying to flesh out the app stores on each device,0
7475,1210,Currently desktop bridge supports in app purchases ,0
7476,1212,As of now there is no good ad network for existing desktop applications ,0
7477,1213,This feature is almost available in any web based video player or any Desktop based video player the feature is simple ,0
7478,1214,When a mediaplayerelement is playing or paused a video ,0
7479,1215,and the user hover overs the seekbar with mouse or pen or any other input device for that perspective wherver is the user mouse show a small thumbnail of the video file at that specific position just above the seekbar slider and as the user moves the mouse along the seekbar the thumbnail should update accordingly ,1
7480,1217,I am aware of the sandboxing ,0
7481,1222,In UWP applications with the codeGeneration manifest capability allow the use of the existing exception table APIs currently marked desktop only ,1
7482,1223,On UWP for x ARM and ARM it is not possible to comply with the Windows ABI when generating code at runtime because you cannot generate the mandatory exception table data for the dynamically generated code ,0
7483,1235,Otherwise this function is useful to runtime code generation ,0
7484,1240,So I uninstalled KB became build ,0
7485,1241,Re try desktop app converter was successes ,0
7486,1242,I think that it is the problem of baseimage and KB ,0
7487,1243,Of course Version build can use the DAC ,0
7488,1244,Currently Microsoft Store under Windows shows three types of information ,0
7489,1248,But there is no numerical value representing the amount of data that will have to be downloaded ,0
7490,1249,Please fix this annoying issue ,0
7491,1251,Many applications need only Desktop support ,0
7492,1252,UWP is too safe so as to be impractical for so many desktop apps and WPF is like a third class citizen with Microsoft in the background cheering Upgrade to UWP ,0
7493,1253,The sandbox nonsense has to go ,0
7494,1257,Let them install it if they so choose ,0
7495,1258, percent of the applications they install are not and will not be sandboxed UWP applications anyway ,0
7496,1270,But it is not available by default ,0
7497,1272,im using file explorer but if ı can seee my otler drives like D drive ore E drive ıts gona be more handfull,0
7498,1273,CalcBinding is an advanced Binding markup extension that allows you to write calculated binding expressions in XAML without custom converters ,0
7499,1274,CalcBinding can automatically perform bool to visibility conversion inverse your expression and more ,0
7500,1275,CalcBinding makes binding expressions shorter and more user friendly ,0
7501,1276,This is only available for WPF url ,0
7502,1277,Here are some examples,0
7503,1285,Right now it is possible to define apps for websites using app URI handlers ,0
7504,1287,These excludePaths feature supports only path matching right now not wildcards for the whole Uri ,0
7505,1290,UWP combobox is not showing the selected value under certain resolutions ,0
7506,1292,In visual studio if I select the container a grid and change something like the flow from horizontal to vertical the redraw fixes the issue which leads me to believe that it is the render ,0
7507,1293,We use the Create Date on log files to check if they can be deleted ,0
7508,1294,The problem is that when we delete that file and recreate it same filename the create date stays the same ,0
7509,1296,How to reproduce ,0
7510,1298,It creates a test log file ,0
7511,1301,Run the code again ,0
7512,1304,The test log file is created again ,0
7513,1305,Check the create on the test log it still has the create date from the first time you ran the code ,0
7514,1308,Run this as many times as you like the create date will not change from the first time you ran the code ,0
7515,1319,It deletes the file ,0
7516,1325,Having SOCK SEQPACKET would remove the burden of distinguishing between independent messages from the user ,1
7517,1326,It also allows greater compatibility for existing POSIX compatible applications as was the original goal for implementing AF UNIX ,0
7518,1327,This would be comparable to the message mode of Windows named pipes making AF UNIX sockets a more complete replacement ,0
7519,1329,Some users certainly will find this useful ,0
7520,1331,Sadly if you are someone who finds this annoying there is no option to disable this behavior ,0
7521,1332,According to the singular post I was able to find on this new feature url there is no way to disable this ,0
7522,1334,The new fall creators update seems to have introduced a ' feature ' where if a user reboots the system any applications that were open well some at least it seems as though to make this issue even more confusing not all applications follow this convention will automatically launch on reboot ,0
7523,1336,Others may find this annoying ,0
7524,1341,It currently only supports octet stream ,0
7525,1342,In trying to use SHA Timestamp current Microsoft guidelines servers the powershell cmdlet set authenticodesignature fails to apply the timestamp ,0
7526,1343,This cmdlet uses the cryptuiwiz api ,0
7527,1344,Here is the sample script to reproduce the error,0
7528,1348,Actually we can not because the same notification would be send too if the user is closing the application ,0
7529,1352,This issue was reported for Visual Studio Feedback Site but They have determined that this issue belongs to universal windows platform ,0
7530,1353,Currently we have no notifying system to the developers when the customer add new feedback to the feedback hub ,0
7531,1355,It is tooo painful ,0
7532,1356,Is it possible to add the notification system ,1
7533,1358,Uservoice already have it ,0
7534,1361,It is a control carryover from as far back as W W Linux Mac system systems have never had this issue,0
7535,1362,Create a new blank UWP application and add this XAML code ,0
7536,1364,When I run this I expect to get no suggestions in the software keyboard when writing anything in the text box ,0
7537,1365,This works as expected on phones but not on computers tablets ,0
7538,1366,I am using Fall Creators update not sure how it behaves in other versions ,0
7539,1368,In my case I am writing an app where you learn how to spell and do not want to give the user any hints emhappy,0
7540,1376,We are developing components on Linux which has dedicated system call and memory requests ,0
7541,1378,This would signify communication and access on the file system ,0
7542,1381,I have some more feature recommendations regarding extensions in adaptivegridview if you will ,0
7543,1384,and which operator to use AND OR in case of multiple property filter provided ,0
7544,1386,and this grouping will obviously include the semantic zoom feature as well ,0
7545,1387,Incremental Loading I know this is already in the community toolkit ,0
7546,1389,Sorting sorting with or more properties ,0
7547,1390,List GridSwitcher there can be a toggle button on the top of the control which can toggle the control to view as a listview each item expanded fully or to a gridview normal grid like behaviour ,1
7548,1391,These are some of the most common scenarios which are required by developers and there are many ways to do it but this can get very complicated to align them with best practices ,0
7549,1394,This can be a very powerful control page yet looking very good to the eye as well ,0
7550,1397,this search bar auto filters the items on basis of the filterDescriptor provided filter descriptor can be defined by the developer tht which stringtimeint property to match with which condition i e Contains startswith endswith e t c ,0
7551,1401,I have used Unity UWP to develop LOB application that visualizes D data from opened files ,0
7552,1402,We also use multiple top level windows that are already available ,0
7553,1403,Now client wants to allow opening and visualizing multiple files which would have been easy with Win just launch another instance ,0
7554,1405,I have a disk imaging which I have already converted application that writes bytes directly to disk USB and SD cards ,0
7555,1407,The app gets rejected during submission to the store as some features are disabled as admin privileges are required ,0
7556,1411,So in a round about way you are actually raising the chances of users getting viruses by blocking these apps as they just get them from the web instead ,0
7557,1418,Current clipboard API can notify about a clipboard content change which is fine ,0
7558,1421,This limitation results in a bad user experience because there are scenarios where the user is working with one application and another application performs some operations based on the copied content ,0
7559,1429,But getting or setting the content does not work if the app is in background or unfocused ,0
7560,1432,Or the other way around where one application creates data and sets the content automatically and the user can directly use it inside another application ,0
7561,1437,Currently the input will be validated if the focus of the Textbox lost ,0
7562,1445,I can verify that this works ,0
7563,1446,But unfortunately it is not possible to create a MediaStreamSample from D D Surface ,0
7564,1449,This will allow us to do full hardware accelerated video decoding ,0
7565,1450,x Bind is great and I love it ,0
7566,1456, This limit appears to be arbitrary and not on par with other platforms iOS Android Mac OSX ,0
7567,1457,This limitation is a contribution to a diminished user experience and developer experience when compared to these other platforms ,0
7568,1459,This idea is so bad on so many levels ,0
7569,1460,So what is the suggestion ,0
7570,1463,As a Xamarin Forms developer I had to drill down frameworks to find this limitation ,0
7571,1464,As bad as the Android docs are they at least make an effort to publish limits ,0
7572,1465, DO NOT SUGGEST a steam roller as a work around to a shortcoming in a fly swatter ,0
7573,1466,Especially if that steam roller is riddled with security issues and complexity way beyond the experience and latitude of most fly swatter users ,0
7574,1467,In this url following forum post the character limit for an email body generated via code from an app is noted ,0
7575,1476,ContentDialog is currently far too difficult to use for two reasons locking and placement ,0
7576,1479,Since only one ContentDialog can be shown at a time a lock is needed such as SemaphoreSlim or a sequential queue of TaskCompletionSource ,1
7577,1480,In other words the class is not complete because normal use of it requires wrapping it in additional code ,0
7578,1482,This means that ContentDialog ShowAsync will wait until any currently displayed ContentDialog is dismissed before showing the new dialog ,0
7579,1485,If ShowAsync or ShowAsync ContentDialogPlacement Popup is used then the location of the dialog is not well controlled ,0
7580,1487,On the other hand if ShowAsync ContentDialogPlacement InPlace is used then a it is not convenient because one must separately embed the dialog in XAML and b it does not always work because an exception occurs if ShowAsync InPlace is called on the dialog before the XAML is fully loaded ,0
7581,1488,For example an error dialog that is required early during program startup cannot be shown based on a copy embedded in XAML ,0
7582,1490, In addition per above a lock of some kind is needed ,0
7583,1502,Currently when the last element s of the tile does not fit because of users with unusual scaling settings for example it get is discarded out of view which is understandable ,0
7584,1504,It also helps with dealing with the scenario where because of the users scaling settings there is too much space on the tile where the developer could have shown extra info ,0
7585,1505,PasswordVault FindAllByResource throws a COMException when there are no credentials for the resource or maybe only when there are no credentials ,0
7586,1506,It should return an empty list without throwing an exception ,0
7587,1507,right now the window closed event for desktop fires both for minimization and for closing events ,0
7588,1508,I understand this is done because of the multiplatform support but it just makes desktop apps with multiple Windows harder o manage so please ,0
7589,1510,A good web example can be found here url ,0
7590,1512,We are able to download previous versions of the release versions of the Windows SDK ,0
7591,1514,On the slow ring we are currently on Windows build but the only SDK download link provided on the Windows Insider download page is for at time of writing ,0
7592,1515,I am not willing to go to fast ring because this renders my laptop useless ,0
7593,1518,When you invoke the primary or secondary buttons in a ContentDialog you are not losing focus in the control that was last being edited ,0
7594,1519,If you are using x Bind to bind that control is value to a property in the ContentDialog code behind page then when you press the primary button the property does not get updated ,0
7595,1520,I have tried forcing the control in this case a TextBox to lose focus programmatically in the Primary buttonevent handler but this does not help ,0
7596,1521,Ive also tried Bindings Update bit this does not help either ,0
7597,1527,The expected behaviour is that when you click on the Primary,0
7598,1528,I can not register dev account because of living in Republic of Moldova ,0
7599,1530,There are thousands of programmists here too ,0
7600,1531,Currently there does not appear to be a way to set a window is startup position left top width right height bottom beyond full screen and or maximized ,0
7601,1532,Also the last used position for a given window is not saved intrinsically ,0
7602,1533,Windows launch at random places on the desktop ,0
7603,1534,I understand this need does not really exist for mobile ,0
7604,1535,But for many desktop applications specifically container applications managing windows is a core feature objective ,0
7605,1536,it is similar like this issue url ,0
7606,1537,We have inherit a control from Slider and put it in horizontal ,0
7607,1538,If Windows set to percent DPI and when slider value is the same as it is maximum value ,0
7608,1539,Our App would crash ,0
7609,1540,If we use Application ExecutablePath when the user open the Shortcut he gets an access permission error so I am trying to create it using shell AppsFolder but I can not get the AppUserModelId,0
7610,1541,I am on a DesktopBridge App and when I try to use Windows ApplicationModel AppInfo it is null,0
7611,1544,Setting ProtextedText to On does not work the selected text is still modifiable ,0
7612,1547,Editor is the value of x Name given to RichEditBox element ,0
7613,1550,RotatorTile is behavior is like an automated FlipView ,0
7614,1553,Microsoft has added in the Camera App the Panorama Mode which works in some devices and tablets ,0
7615,1554,Do not know if it is a specific number of devices that currently this feature works ,0
7616,1556,Is this possible to use this feature in our Windows App Store Universal Apps and if we can do we have any sample code to accomplish this ,0
7617,1557,Do not want a solution with the scrollviewer and the compass because I have already done that ,0
7618,6720,The app list should be in grid style and background should be customized ,1
7619,6721,The keyborad should also be customized like the gadget comfort on screen keyboard in windows desktop ,1
7620,6724,Please allow us to maintain all app packages store assets descriptions screenshots and metadata in a Git repository and simply push to a Git remote to upload ,1
7621,6728,Instead we could get everything ready locally and do a push and upload it all quickly ,1
7622,6732,What I would like to see is a button on the language description pages that are supported for an app ,1
7623,6737,and put it onto the description field for Japanese for example For my app I have it in about language Country descriptions which is a big task to handle ,0
7624,6738,The user could then review the translations as best as they could ,0
7625,6739,And if Microsoft could not translate it it could just copy over the original text ,0
7626,6742,That would take your default language description and fields and then use Microsoft is Translator to translate all the fields to the language ,0
7627,6745,Please add support C CX extension and type system for Desktop platform ,1
7628,6750,And it is good if it will be work on Windows too ,1
7629,6757,Please comment and document this behavior,1
7630,6760,Therefore I want to request adding of some improvements in WinRT API to bring Frame is behavior closer to it is analog from WP Silverlight ,1
7631,6780,So would be great if Microsoft things in this way also ,0
7632,6782,It should be typed as it is typed in Gujarati ' ' ,0
7633,6788,It would be great to have a Background Trigger when that data was changed on another device ,1
7634,6799,It is great that we can Schedule Tile updates so that I can always show the latest timings on the tile itself but I would love it if I could do the same thing with Badges ,1
7635,6806,Attempting to use TextAlignment within Page Resources and referencing it via StaticResource in a Universal Windows App will compile but throw an exception ,0
7636,6809,When Cortana has an expression that it does not understand based on the available expressions registered but Cortana does recognize an app name it would be great if the user is expression was fed to the app account on the store for the developer to review and consider supporting in the future ,1
7637,6818,Window should stay the size I left it ,1
7638,6831,Please add CAN API to be included in the Windows Devices ,1
7639,6837,Companies like CSHTML url and DuoCode url are already doing this but it would be great to see this effort officially adopted into the Microsoft Universal Windows Platform ,0
7640,6841,A mechanism that operates like PhoneGap Cordova would have to be implemented so that access to external hardware APIs can be achieved ,1
7641,6859,A Bonus would be to be able to set a link for all users incl Net API preferred at least Win API,1
7642,6867,Hope there are some automated tool for taking localised screenshots ,0
7643,6869,My thought Using simulator while on a page a one click button that automatically take one screenshot for each language the app supports ,0
7644,6871,In the upload website a way to remove all screenshots and a way to upload all assets for all languages at once ,1
7645,6872,Developers should be able to make custom lockscreen app ,1
7646,6878,It is very important that we support beta for both Windows Phone and Windows ,1
7647,6881,Allow users of paint to select parts of images on an image they are drawing or editing diagonally other than only horizontally vertically ,1
7648,6883,You could even make it possible to select the angle at which you select a certain part of the image manually and this would certainly make editing in paint a lot easier ,1
7649,6885,Please provide the ability to the developer to change the color of the keyboard inside their app ,1
7650,6888,Now this may not be so bad in English which has relatively short words but languages like German or Danish make heavy use of compound words ,0
7651,6889,Words can get very long and thus hyphenation is needed especially on small screens ,1
7652,6896,This would also bring feature parity with HTML JS apps which already more,0
7653,6897,API to detect incoming call and number so it can be blocked if not necessary and also can ring even in silent if it is important ,1
7654,6902,It would be great to have the option for creating Publisher ' s shared roaming folder as well ,1
7655,6904,Open sideloading for everyone ,1
7656,6908,It would be better if this file was in JSON format and followed the Manifest for web application standard from W C url ,1
7657,6910,Allow changing country and publisher name after registration on the Store,1
7658,6915,Please either extend the existing class to consider the use cases for the phone or ditch it and come up with something more like Apple is approach which works better than what is currently there ,1
7659,6919,Unfortunately this means the app is a none starter because the files can be several gigabytes in size so it kills the user experience everytime they try to open a file ,0
7660,6920,The Emulator should support SensorSDK,1
7661,6925,I propose you add a proper unit test suite for the WinJS platform that can be automated and ideally run from common JavaScript tools like Grunt ,1
7662,6934,Please document how transitions work and expose the necessary API for us to create our own drop in replacements for the limited set of transitions supplied by the existing APIs ,1
7663,6935,For example on WP if I want to use a custom transition I can fake the transition by using animations at the exit and entry to a page but in order for this to work I need to remove the existing stack of transitions from the frame because navigation will reuse the last transition from the frame is collection ,0
7664,6938,At the very least we need a No Op transition that can be used to prevent the frame is stack from using the last transition to animate the page change ,1
7665,6959,This feature is to ask for Xaml serialization featureset parity with WPF System Xaml ,1
7666,6962,It could be better to have search box in windows phone application instead of having it in windows application alone ,1
7667,6964,Auto focusing the input element in page ready is not working in windows mobile application ,0
7668,6966,As a developer I should have access to the entire WinRT API if I am building an app for my own personal device ,1
7669,6970,Perhaps more developers would build for Windows if they can build their own tools for personal use without so many restrictions ,1
7670,6980,This is an excellent feature but I would love to see the same tools and support available for the shared project in a universal WinJS app ,1
7671,6981,It would be great to use Bower to install scripts once into the shared project rather than installing two copies of the same script into the Windows project and the Windows Phone project ,1
7672,6982,It makes sense to disallow universal C # Xaml apps installing packages to the shared project because they might only target Windows or only target Windows Phone ,1
7673,6984,Therefore there should be no problem with installing scripts directly to the shared project using Bower instead of installing two copies of the same script to two different projects ,0
7674,6992,It would make sense i think that en no region language will be used as a fallback for all en countries if there is no en region specified ,1
7675,7003,Please implement a permanent fix to the relevant back end systems ,1
7676,7004,Also we need a supplementary fix to the issues faced by existing affected users without resorting them to contacting Microsoft customer support to restore their purchase by way of adding credit to re purchase the app ,1
7677,7017,If you add more than a few like the performance is so bad that you have to wait for a few seconds after you stop to be sure that the pins controls are in the right position ,0
7678,7032,Either use the Identity version throughout the Store and let us change that with the Visual Studio Wizard or ensure that the Dev Center reads the Package version rather than Identity version ,1
7679,7036,Visual Studio is Create Package wizard allows one to assign a version number however this assigns the Package version number ,0
7680,7050,I would like some way so that I can have my various devices each with different form factor get the latest build deployed to them all or a select number of them instead of debugging simply failing ,1
7681,7086,PubCenter users should be able to decide how much they want to receive when they get a payment ,1
7682,7088,It would be great if I could decide to receive less money in a single payment and keep the rest for the next year ,1
7683,7089,Expose an API that allows apps aside Phone and Messaging to trigger Person reminders ,1
7684,7104,Polish your new Contact Manager api to get the maximum performance Hence the user not to sit idle till it loads ,1
7685,7107,It may be based on number only contacts contacts with email address or filtering only phone contacts other than any social contacts etc ,0
7686,7120,Please consider my suggestion on this case,0
7687,7130,Please provide a simpler example with a clearer coding ,1
7688,7133,I think it is good to explain what is default image ,1
7689,7137,Please provide support for adding developer user id to Windows Developer account ,1
7690,7139,Hope that Microsoft if possible allow us individuals to create individual developer account for FREE and allowed only to publish one app on Windows Phone or Windows store ,1
7691,7157,Please add a link to url that links to the password change page at url ,1
7692,7158,Also add the same LIVE profile password change link to the Windows Store profile ,1
7693,7160,Might be nice to make it easier to find the right password change page ,1
7694,7161,Allow background services to display controls on top of other applications ,1
7695,7162,It would be great to for example play a video in a small square box while browsing the web or respond to messages without having to open a message app ,1
7696,7163,Please support m u live streamings,1
7697,7164,Please Please Please expand the ' Email Signature ' function so that you are able to include a detailed signature including embeded images ,1
7698,7166,By using the FileOpenPicker class we can filter shown files by extensin but I think we should also be able to filter files by their name let us say I only want to show pictures whose name start with ABCD or whose name ends with BCD ,1
7699,7169,So Please Provide this option ,0
7700,7173,The dev team should be able to access info through the dashboard ,1
7701,7192,Make Net available on all platforms including Mac Linux all Smartphones ,1
7702,7207,Microsoft could have created more tools for integrating NHibernate easily into net apps but they developed EntityFramework instead more,1
7703,7208,Just like in WinRT could we have Spell Checking options and Text Prediction in Window Phone Silverlight apps ,1
7704,7209,I was working on clipboard manager application for windows and discovered that there is no way to catch Clipboard ContentChanged event when application is running in background seems the life cycle of WinRT app does not allow this ,0
7705,7210,Wish I would have a possibility to create a background task that is triggered by clipboard content changed system event ,1
7706,7212,Add WebP support so I can easily process and export images using the format ,1
7707,7214,We want access to every camera available at same tima ,1
7708,7224,I think there should be a property maybe something like ShowDeleteButton that allows you to specify whether the Delete button is displayed ,1
7709,7226,A B testing is crucial for quantitative marketing ,0
7710,7235,I would like to see the ability to re order my related apps so I can choose which related apps get promoted first to users ,1
7711,7238,Let the local apps install without need to access to windows phone store just like exe files in windows ,1
7712,7242,After profiling the app I found that after calling MediaCapture capturePhotoToStorageFileAsync method memory is not released and allocates MB with each call ,0
7713,7243,I have also voted for this suggestion as that could fix most of camera related issues on Windows phone ,0
7714,7251,The only way to detect it is by looking for UnauthorizedException but that exception is ambiguous ,0
7715,7256,A location permission dialog may be showing when a network error occurs in an unrelated part of the code for example ,0
7716,7269,Perhaps ensuring a year gap between signups would be enough of a deterrent to those that may want to maliciously close their account regularly ,1
7717,7274,Please include my country Yemen in pay out and advertisement too ,1
7718,7279,DatePicker should be allowed to have a null value initially and not a programmatically set that could accidentally be mistake for a user is input ,1
7719,7281,Setting DayVisible to false prevents the spinner from showing which is nice but then the date is displayed when the value is shown in the field which sort of negates the feature ,0
7720,7288,It would be nice if an app could provide it is own tasks todos to the OS ,1
7721,7297,I do alot of copying and pasting and would really like to see a customized copy and paste built into windows ,1
7722,7300,That way when I paste I still have the other files in memory to paste elsewhere ,0
7723,7304,If I can copy like say different files folders it would be nice to have a selection when I right click and place my mouse over paste I would like to see a Paste All Paste select which would have check boxes on each folder file I have selected to copy ,1

7938,9120,I would suggest to include all Transactions in the Report ,1
7939,9123,All uesr want to find fast their contact when they must call so it is very good to insert the fast search on phone dialer it is good that the user can choose the better method to search like name or and surname or and Address etc ,1
7940,9124,i think it is good that th apps can access to the list of installed apps and can decide to unistall or freeze or lock etc ,0
7941,9125,Allow downloading of submissioned xap files in Windows Phone application publish submission process ,1
7942,9127,Please make kids corner as a another account ,1

7945,9143,Would be great to discover Service Hosts in local Networks ,1
7946,9148,Provide an automation toolkit to enable developers to walk through a series of steps and take screenshots at relevant points then re run those steps in different languages to automate the process of taking screenshots in different languages for app submission ,1
7947,9149,Would also be helpful in it is own right for general localization testing to verify that localized strings have messed up layout ,1
7948,9150,As a developer the only way to increase app ratings and review is to prompt user ,0
7949,9157,I was expecting some notification center on the site so that i can see what new things have happened over my account since my last visit ,1
7950,9159,Let me be able to see the reviews that are added or app crashes so that my attention towards them grows infinitely large ,1
7951,9162,I want in WP back it stiill works in WP that I can set a color for ApplicationBar Icons ,1
7952,9186,is not it better to allow developers to change their app name inside app store according to different language and culture ,1
7953,9223,This would be very useful in the resource constrained environment of a phone ,0
7954,9225, Allow more code to be shared across platforms and,1
7955,9233,I would also be nice to be able to retain some kind of unique key the app could store or some other way the app can have a way to query ' to do ' items that the app created ,1
7956,9236,A shared key chain to share data between the apps this help in apps with features like SSO,1
7957,9237,Include support for pen input like on the surface pro and surface pro for both WP and RT,1

7959,9244,Allow the phone to be used as a mini presentation device ,1
7960,9245,This can allow the phone to be used as a secondary display or project the screen contents on for example Push TV devices or Widi Receivers,0
7961,9271,Please Make it possible to build WP Apps emsad,1
7962,9279,The app should have more advanced options for scheduling when and how often it will run in the background perhaps by setting a different interval for different days of the week or times of the day or by specifying the time until it will run again each time it runs ,1
7963,9280,Users should be given insight into how often an application is running in the background so they can decide which applications are worth allowing to process in the background and which are not ,1
7964,9282,Furthermore the second duration should be expanded to at least seconds to account for larger data transfers and slower network connections ,1
7965,9293,This is also a capability that other mobile platforms have and I think it is needed to build quality apps with a good user experience ,0
7966,9296,Apps should get at least seconds of background processing time to complete such network transfers and process the response ,1
7967,9308,In my opinion Chinese app are mainly design for Chinese and handsets are mostly from China Market Its may be challenging for developers to get phones from different countries or regions ,0
7968,9310,Having said these I propose such feature of prompting to do a language pack installation to be on the Windows Phone OS level when user switches language ,1
7969,9312,Having said these i thought a feature for prompting user installing language pack done on phone OS level would be good ,1
7970,9318,Provide access to Playlist API to be able to create auto playlists based on the song library on the phone ,1
7971,9320,If we use diferent datatemplates why not make every panel virtualizable ,1
7972,9327,For example I would love it if my GPS app could turn location on when the app starts and turn it back off when the app exits ,1
7973,9336,An developer should have an option or tool to manage that list and select which ones are displayed ,1
7974,9348,Under this suggestion the developer should be unable to manage or modify the base standard images this suggestion is only for adding additional images ,1
7975,9349,The Windows Phone emulator should include the ability to manage VM snapshots for Windows Phone images ,1
7976,9352,If you want to load content after you reach the end of a list you have to write your own user control or create data bindings ,0
7977,9354,If NavigationService Navigate would let us pass a parameter of type object along with the URI it will help us to keep less states objects in the App class which will become a mess as project grows ,1
7978,9358,Please provide a PhotoCropTask that takes an Image Byte and provides the same crop tool ,1
7979,9359,Include a PixelHeight and PixelWidth as optional parameters so an aspect ratio can be included ,1
7980,9360,This would allow for Picture cropping ,0
7981,9363,Provide an API s that allow apps to either control Settings eg being able to toggle WiFi when NFC tag is interacted ,1
7982,9364,Also it would be nice if there was an API that allowed an app to be integrated into the Settings Applets instead of a standard app ,1
7983,9374,I would like to see the Windows App store be similar to Google where I can skip the hassle and headache of certification and just get an app on the store in hours not days ,1
7984,9384,Allow us developers to renew our expired subscriptions ,1
7985,9386,I have asked the support they said me that I have to create another subscription with another live account and after it ask them to migrate apps and related data ,0
7986,9398,It is not healthy to keep several accounts that means nothing specially ones that you just had to create because you need to renew the subscription,0
7987,9413,Please provide any idea about background service in wm as gps tracking automatically ,1
7988,9416,If Windows Phone as any faith in it is future it needs a lot more support from the development team ,0
7989,9424,If you want people to develop apps you need to offer a dev platform that does not only run on the latest and greatest machines ,1
7990,9426,We miss a control like the integrated photo viewer to show photos or any controls page by page by using flick gestures ,1
7991,9437,It should be an option to remove the ru language code from my app ' language History ' ,1
7992,9440, You can publish an update with the removed ru language but this update will not fully replace the old version and you will in truble ,0
7993,9473,I think Placement should be splitted in HorizontalPlacement Left Center Right and VerticalPlacement Top Bottom to have more flexibility ,1
7994,9481,I would like to have a reminder system API that allows me to know if the phone is near a phone from a friend location based ,1
7995,9482,Example Remind me to ask Holly about the project status when I meet her the next time ,0
7996,9489,I think this will be the wrong way ,0
7997,9492,I am a professional software engineer and I am developing with Visual Studio at work So I thougt it is a goot idea to buy a windows phone because I could develop some phone applications ,0
7998,9497,It would be very convenient to just click a button and have your app placed in only the markets that we do not need to worry about taxes ,1
7999,9518,Since changing is not an option you will need to create a new account within the Turkey region ,0
8000,9522,Since you have mentioned that you are a student account this might require you to create to simultaneous accounts ,0
8001,9525,Note that if you have a Store account the apps from that side will not transfer ,0
8002,9537,It would be great if there were specific classes that could be instantiated on non ui threads and then loaded by ui thread image objects ,1
8003,9542,This would be very useful in determining why sometimes upload is slow,0
8004,9543,Mark sideloaded apps in app list so one can differentiate an in store app from a side loaded version that is in development ,1
8005,9546,Like surface pro implementing the pressure layer pen on wp and win RT,0
8006,1567,Convert EXE to APPX by command lines ,0
8007,1571,It is century ,0
8008,1572,I know that text boxes can be customized easily ,0
8009,1573,But the UWP textboxes are not that god when it comes to numeric input ,0
8010,1574,I am currently working on a software that has a lot of numeric input ,0
8011,1578,Only allows numeric input,0
8012,1587,Format numbers with commas on thousands ie,0
8013,1591,If the user enters a value less than the min value the value will be updated to min value on lost focus ,0
8014,1610,Notice that Intellisense suggests Test for the bind path,0
8015,1613,The same with old stlye Binding works fine,0
8016,1614,Comparison results with Edge on the right ,0
8017,1618,App tested is WebView Release ,0
8018,1619,Tried both WebViewExecutionMode SeparateThread,0
8019,1621,Even rendering on separate thread will block UI thread for example Reveal highlight effect while bigger page is loading or typing into TextBox will lag while javascript in the page is running ,0
8020,1623,Currently it is impossible to implement context menus save files and implement other functions general web browsers have ,0
8021,1627,Every modern operating system on this planet uses LF style line endings except for Windows which still writes one more useless byte at every end of a line ,0
8022,1628,It is time for a change ,0
8023,1648,What can i do ,0
8024,1649,My Windows is Version Build ,0
8025,1664,Something in both Silverlight and WPF but missing from UWP Tiled brushes ,0
8026,1665, Although curiously TileBrush is still the base class for brushes just without tiling emsad ,0
8027,1666,This will allow use of tiled images and perhaps videos for use as brushes anywhere a XAML Brush is accepted like Backgrounds Text foregrounds Path fills etc ,0
8028,1667,I want my UWP UI to look the same across any screen of the same resolution regardless of the scale factor applied by Windows ,0
8029,1668,For instance when running my app on the Hololens it applies a percent scale factor ,0
8030,1669,This means the UI looks squished when compare to a desktop screen of a similar resolution x ,0
8031,1671,Can this be implemented for the Hololens ,0
8032,1674,There are situations where you might want to interrupt navigating away from a page when using NavigationView ,0
8033,1675,Say you throw up a message box a la Do you want to save the changes Yes No Cancel if you were to click Cancel there is no way to prevent the NavigationView to follow through with it visually ,0
8034,1676,Say you have two menu items one Home and the other Whatever ,0
8035,1678,There is no sane way to do it example ,0
8036,1679,a Cancel boolean on the event args of the ItemInvoked event ,0
8037,1680,An example for this would be this budgeting app I am currently working on ,0
8038,1681,If you are editing a transaction but have not committed it trying to navigate away I would like to throw up a Save Changes ,0
8039,1682,message box with the typical Yes No Cancel options ,0
8040,1683,I can not deal with the Cancel action without code voodoo trying to revert the SelectedItem ASAP ,0
8041,1684,Thanks for considering changing this ,0
8042,1690,In my opinion UWP is too much APP centric ,0
8043,1691,We are spending and loosing a great amount of time working around trying to do simple things like pass command line arguments write on folders trying to execute another program ,0
8044,1694,OS information is not included at all on the ' Usage ' page ,0
8045,1695,While I get crashes by OS Health page I need to cross reference this with usage by OS to determine the overall impact of a given bug ,0
8046,1698,We are currently developing for desktop only screens we have control over the device types and want to prevent users from sizing the window smaller than px x px ,0
8047,1699,This application is far too complex for mobile screens and x is too small ,0
8048,1700,Is this an option we can hope for in the near future ,0
8049,1702,The default MenuFlyoutSubItem allows you to add subitems either through XAML or the Items code behind property ,0
8050,1704,I am currently trying to convert an application that contains some of the CoreUtils utilities most notably exe and exe ,0
8051,1705,This fails abruptly at Preparing Virtual File System,0
8052,1707,VERBOSE Begin Convert Files ,0
8053,1708,VERBOSE Renaming ' Files wouldirectory to ' VFS ' ,0

8058,1714,PowerShell Error Record ,0
8059,1715,The specified wildcard character pattern is not valid exe,0
8060,1716,PowerShell Stack Trace ,0
8061,1725,System Management Automation WildcardPatternException The specified wildcard character pattern is at System Management Automation WildcardPattern IsMatch String input ,0
8062,1784,Looking at the VfsOps ps file it seems that the Test Path on line assumes that the file path is a standard wildcard not a file name ,0
8063,1785,Looks like it could be fixed by adding Management Automation WildcardPattern Escape somewhere but I have not been able to find out how to make the catalog writeable so that I can test this ,0
8064,1789,When running through C Code Analysis projects using ATL will minimally hit the following atlcom h warnings ,0
8065,1791,Buffer overrun while writing to ' m pDACL ' the writable size is ' pDACL AclSize ' bytes but ' ' bytes might be written ,0
8066,1795,Buffer overrun while writing to ' newACL ' the writable size is ' aclSize ' bytes but ' ' bytes might be written ,0
8067,1798,Orbit View Currently have D plane so for Mixed Reality Apps third Dimension needed to expand it functionality ,0
8068,1799,Like for example for Space apps where Earth have satellites NEO and space stations and they all have orbits based on earth so orbital view in D make it better in Mixed reality,0
8069,1804,Is there some sort of bug tracker for Microsoft software ,0
8070,1805,Kinda like UserVoice but for bug reports ,0
8071,1806,I have an app that works normally but when launched via the Desktop Bridge there is some strange issues with COM ,0
8072,1807,What does the Desktop Bridge do differently ,0
8073,1810,CoreApplication now has a RequestRestartAsync method but it fails in a Desktop Bridge app with NotInForeground ,0
8074,1813,I wonder if this is because of the way the Desktop Bridge technology wraps the WPF application ,0
8075,1814,Any ideas on how I can cause the app to restart ,0
8076,1816,However collapsing a pivot item does not remove it from the UI visual tree ,0
8077,1817,The header still ' exists ' and is keyboard focus able ,0
8078,1818,Since you can correctly hide ListBoxItems I am considering this a bug ,0
8079,1820,Repeatedly calling MediaPlayer StepForwardOneFrame ` MediaPlayer StepBackOneFrame should switch between two frames but video is moving slightly back ,0
8080,1821,Repository on github url ,0
8081,1823,At first this is not an issue since the control is not Visible ,0
8082,1824,However if you make the parent visible binding will not be triggered and you must manually force an update to get bound values to appear ,0
8083,1825,This was probably done as a performance optimization however binding needs to recognize visibility changes if it will not bind when an item is not visible in the UI ,0
8084,1826,Otherwise yet again MVVM is broken ,0
8085,1827,I have a UWP UserControl line chart that renders a PathFigure to a Canvas ,0
8086,1828,This chart supports zooming and the PathFigure size is changed during zoom but clipped within the visible Chart area ,0
8087,1829,At high zoom levels above percent the entire UWP app will crash with a native exception An unhandled win exception occured in app ,0
8088,1831,There must be a bug some place in the framework ,0
8089,1832,This crash only happens using the Fall Creators Update after the clipping issue was fixed ,0
8090,1833,I am guessing it is a numerical overflow somewhere deep in the graphics stack ,0
8091,1837,From my viewpoint I think there is no way in managed code I should be getting a native exception like this ,0
8092,1840,The following Hyper V networking Configuration breaks DNS name resolution on the Virtual Machine ,0
8093,1842,Connecting the host to a non corporate remote WiFi network ,0
8094,1847,When a VM is connected to the default switch and the host is connected to the corporate network via Cisco AnyConnect the VM looses the ability to resolve DNS addresses ,0
8095,1848,The VM is able to ping both public addresses and corporate addresses however it is unable to resolve names on either the public internet or corporate network ,0
8096,1849,This issue was submitted as a MS Premier support ticket url and a Connect bug url ,0
8097,1850,Was advised by Premier that this is an architectural issue ,0
8098,1857,Start a VM and connect it to the Default Switch NAT ,0
8099,1862,Using the fall creator is update version of UWP it seems that when a data context is changed to a new view model the previous view model is updated with null values ,0
8100,1863,This is the same as if the DataContext is set to null before changing view models ,0
8101,1864,It does not make sense why the bound values are updated when the DataContext is changed ,0
8102,1867,In stack overflow or any other forums we have option to add multiple tags related to our question ,0
8103,1868,Currently is not possibile to create a new Calendar inside an Enterprise Exchange user account ,0
8104,1869,It is only allowed to create an app calendar which lives on local device,0
8105,1871,The Windows Services Store namespace does not provide a class that you can use to simulate license info during testing ,0
8106,1874,At the moment a VSTO add in cannot be published on Windows Store or on Office Store ,0
8107,1875,An idea could be extending Desktop App Converter tool in order to manage VSTO add in ,1
8108,1877,I reported that since studio the designer crash due to attached properties,0
8109,1881,Changing to last UWP solve the designer problem but the attached properties are not working the binding and I have to do set binding by code,0
8110,1888,While understandable that there are big challenges to overcome to make this possible but currently the bar to create optional packages is too high due that the time investment and issues that can occur makes it not that worh it due the C requirement ,0
8111,1892,The CreateStreamedFileAsync method is there since Windows to delay creation of file data ,0
8112,1893,However when using the result in a Drag Drop or Clipboard operation Windows Explorer errors out with x No such interface supported ,0
8113,1894,It can be used between UWP apps but not in Windows Explorer which really is a shame ,0
8114,1895,There are desktop Win APIs for delay creation of files that are used heavily example ,0
8115,1896,in WinZIP and similar applications to delay actual unzip of files until really required but they cannot be used in UWP ,0
8116,1897,Please support the UWP equivalent called CreateStreamedFileAsync in Windows Explorer ,1
8117,1899,Things like MinConnectionInterval MaxConnectionInterval SlaveLatency and Connection Supervisory Timeout,0
8118,1901,It is a compendium of various PDF viewer tutorials rolled into a single user control ,0
8119,1902,I have no doubt it could be improved by community involvement ,0
8120,1905,The documentation may be found here ,0
8121,1909,An given example of the API can be seen below ,0
8122,1919,Under UWP it is still not possible to open a folder or file out of the sandbox ,0
8123,1920,Even to suggest a path is not possible ,0
8124,1921,So your are not able to suggest a folder or file to the user by a path string ,0
8125,1922,So at the moment i have to tell my customers open the folder picker and navigate from the pictures library to the path emlaugh emannoyed very long path final folder ,0
8126,1923,and thereby the folderpicker has no preview to the content in a folder ,0
8127,1925,actual implementing an selection of file or folder in UWP how easy but stupid ,0
8128,1932,so picker SuggestedStartLocation is not a string to a path but only a selection of libraries ,0
8129,1933,does microsoft really believe that users and developers accept that lowest budget setup ,0
8130,1934,now after the great Windows Fall Creators Update it is still a joke to switch and develop to UWP ,0
8131,1936,does anybody at MS have an idea how to propose an path in an UWP application ,0
8132,1943,We will currently I have a Uwp app that needs to call a web api service that is secured with azure ad ,0
8133,1944,I have been looking for samples and tutorials to do this and I have found some ,0
8134,1945,But they all differ in what to do exactly ,0
8135,1955,I have created AppPinManager helper class just call those helper fuunction it will takecare to add into the startmenu or TaskBar,0
8136,1959,For example a long running task where the user is not allowed to back out until it completes ,0
8137,1961,Currently UWP Community Toolkit includes seven services that are very useful but more is always better it would be awesome to add more and more services including a big one for a lot of people WordPress ,1
8138,1964,To clarify that this can be done from Windows as a part of Windows administration and configuration for instance via Group Policies PowerShell Windows Updates Schedule Tasks etc ,0
8139,1972,There are several issues with the file activation NeighboringFilesQuery argument and the file system indexer ,0
8140,1974,If files are loaded using the NeighboringFilesQuery then GetPropertiesAsync on those files will only return properties that have been indexed ,0
8141,1975,This prevents reading things like altitude from the GPS location data ,0
8142,1977,The above is made a lot worse on computers where indexing file content is disabled right click on the drive in Explorer select properties and see check box at the bottom which used to be recommended for SSD drives ,0
8143,1978,In particular no ImageProperties are available in this case ,0
8144,1979,It also happens if the indexer is not working properly which is not uncommon ,0
8145,1981,If the indexer is really broken for some reason this started happening on my computer so is not uncommon then it will fail to pick up any neighboring files at all confirmed by using the default Photos app to open a photo in a folder with lots of photos and it only showed one photo ,0
8146,1984,I do not think this is a security issue because the data is in the file and the file contents are readable ,0
8147,1997,This will enable automatic testing on hybrid windows apps where DOM inspection is necessary ,0
8148,1998,When setting ToolTipService Placement to Mouse the text in the tooltip is no longer sharp ,0
8149,1999,It looks like the tooltip is not perfectly aligned to the device pixels but rather half a pixel off vertically ,0
8150,2000,This is on Windows Fall Creators Update build @ percent DPI scale the app targets Windows SDK ,0
8151,2003,Would be a lot more intuitive useful and less distractive then the current overlay ,0
8152,2006,The way ink Input is currently handled is sooo Win emwink I know there is InkCanvas and Windows UI Input Inking Analysis put this should be build into the text controls in a standard way ,0
8153,2009,Imagine writing text directly into the TextBox or RichEditBox canvas without the Ink Keyboard Overlay ,1
8154,2015,It limits the use case of MasterView ,0
8155,2016,We can not use Pivot Semantic Zoom GridView PullToRefresh SlidableListItem and more ,0
8156,2018,Do not fake the page navigation using Storyboard ,0
8157,2019,Then devs can use Connected Animations ,0
8158,2020,I upgraded to the latest VS and change my UWP app to use Net Native ,0
8159,2021,It now gets a number of linker problems that are being caused by Microsoft components ,0
8160,2025,Calling this method would throw exception at runtime ,0
8161,2027,If for some reason your P Invoke does not satisfy those requirements please use DllImport ExactSpelling true to indicate that you understand the implications of using non UWP APIs,1
8162,2029,I do not call this function ,0
8163,2030,When I traced down some new crashes I found that Socket ConnectAsync is trying to call this function and failing because it does not exist ,0
8164,2031,I have about similar errors in the build that are referencing things I do not directly call ,0
8165,2032,I have reverted to Net Native until this gets fixed ,0
8166,2044,In Windows Forms toolkit there is a handy control called the NumericUpDownControl ,0
8167,2062,Current appextension only supports loading assets and scripts ,1
8168,2063,In many scenarios rd party author may provide some code actable with the main app for example decoding another file format ,1
8169,2064,There may be trusting problems ,0
8170,2065,If you change the DataPackageOperation to Copy the problem goes away ,0
8171,2067,We are experiencing an issue where the presence of a PasswordBox with a NumericPin InputScope overrides the InputScope of other controls on the page until the PasswordBox has received focus ,0
8172,2068,On a touch screen this manifests every time a user reaches the first page in our UWP App that has a NumericPin scoped PasswordBox ,0
8173,2072, Build and run the app,0
8174,2074, See that the touch keyboard is the NumericPin keyboard even though the focused TextBox should have the default InputScope ,0
8175,2075, Click into TextBox ,0
8176,2078,Keyboard remains NumericPin ,0
8177,2080, See that the InputScopes of the TextBoxes are now honored ,0
8178,2094, Add the XAML below to MainPage xaml,0
8179,2096, Before doing anything else click the Show touch keyboard button in the notification tray such that the touch keyboard appears ,0
8180,2098,I think I found a problem in Media Player ,0
8181,2099,The problem happens on phone if media player is paused from another media app ,0
8182,2100,In this case will be fired only MediaPlayer PlaybackSession PlaybackStateChanged event and it is not possible to detect whether app was paused through user or system ,0
8183,2101,But if phone calls then will be simulated SystemMediaTransportControls pause button click MediaPlayer SystemMediaTransportControls ButtonPressed event and on phone call I can correctly stop my player and change some states ,0
8184,2106,I am preloading images for speed and I need to release the memory immediately when no longer needed to prevent memory failures but setting the reference to null and even calling GC Collect immediately does not always result in an immediate release of memory ,0
8185,2107,I have looked into using a SoftwareBitmapSource instead but this is a lot slower and uses more memory and I am not percent sure whether it is Dispose method works does not affect memory shown in VS debugger but did seem to have an effect when testing using a mobile emulator ,0
8186,2111,Compact overlay window is always shown at the right top corner ,0
8187,2114,Conditional check does not actually solve the problem it does not suit the control like NavigationView since at the end developer still have to create a NavigationView with SplitView which is really pain to maintain ,0
8188,2117,More details can be found in this issue url ,0
8189,2119,We can see the support of communities in UWcomputerommunityToolkit ,0
8190,2121,As a self learner it is very hard to find a tutorial to learn new things ,0
8191,2122,MapControl has some nice extensibility options but requires specifying a token even if you are using local or custom tile sources as the background replacement layer ,0
8192,2124,I hear a lot about clean uninstall but we noticed a few months ago appx leaves some stuff behind ,0
8193,2125,Specifically persisted appframe window sizing data remains behind potentially leaving the user dev in a potential bad or confusing window state ,0
8194,2126,See the data piling up in the following stores ,0
8195,2130,A lot of small time developers like myself do not have the means to use the Microsoft Store to host their apps ,0
8196,2131,I develop applications for the military and the IT department barely has any idea what they are doing ,0
8197,2133,Win apps still dominate because they are so robust and developed ,0
8198,2134,To bring in new and old developers bring back the same functionality that is found in WPF and Winforms ,0
8199,2140,Assume the following XAML and not calling SetDesiredBounds ,0
8200,2154,This is what the screen looks like url ,0
8201,2155, sorry for the photo could not do a regular screen shot at the moment ,0
8202,2156,Looks good ,0
8203,2157,Yes video and transport controls cover the entire media player ,0
8204,2159,In full screen transport controls not video do also respect the safe area ,0
8205,2164,Otherwise this looks cut and incomplete ,0
8206,2165,Nevertheless so far this is ok and could be called as expected ,0
8207,2166,So far so good ,0
8208,2167,Now let us turn on DesiredBoundsMode ,0
8209,2169,The safe area is removed and it looks like the following url ,0
8210,2171,Page has no more safe area BUT on the transport controls have suddenly the safe area even though the media player is part WITHIN the page ,0
8211,2172, For full screen it remains the same framed version as before so no additional screen shot Why are transport controls no longer covering the entire video ,0
8212,2174,That is an real issue ,0
8213,2175,I am removing the safe area by calling SetDesiredBounds and I am experiencing framed transport controls then even when using as control somewhere within the page ,0
8214,2177,I debugged this a lot and found a solution and realized a very dirty hack by Microsoft ,0
8215,2178,In my app I am using custom transport controls and I used the original template as a starting point ,0
8216,2179,I found out that there is a grid element with x name ControlPanelGrid and on Xbox it gets magically a margin of ,0
8217,2180,This is documented nowhere and has the bad effect described above ,0
8218,2181,Removing the x name or renaming that element is enough the margin is gone ,0
8219,2182,Nevertheless I would expect a less hacky solution ,0
8220,2184,Having a safe area within a media element is transport controls when not full screen is definitely a bug ,0
8221,2185,And fiddling arround with a grid by name is just a dirty hack since this does not work with custom transport controls as long as the magic grid with it is name is not present ,0
8222,2197,The MediaPlayerElement supports various subtitle formats ,0
8223,2198,But when we play a video file using MediaStreamSource it is not possible to pass through the subtitle streams because we cannot create MediaStreamDescriptors for them ,0
8224,2199,So audio and video works but subtitles do not work ,0
8225,2201,This would be very helpful to make the MS initiated FFmpegInterop truly unviersally useful ,0
8226,2202,I am unable to use containers and VmWare VirtualBox on Windows at the same time due to the restriction of Hyper V ,0
8227,2203,This restriction does not exist on Linux and MacOS ,0
8228,2204,Why force me to reboot to disable enable Hyper V ,0
8229,2205,Why does Hyper V lock out other virtualization software ,0
8230,2206,The WPF UniformGrid url is missing in UWP ,0
8231,2207,It does not seem to quite have an equivalent in UWP in order to get even spacing of a grid automatically as well as other features like setting rows columns and first column for calendar type applications ,0
8232,2209,We need this so we can directly start searches within Cortana from our apps ,0
8233,2213, Camera app using display as a flash to light up when using front facing camera ,0
8234,2216,A previous uservoice API to control screen brightness url was marked closed after Creators update with Brightness control being introduced ,0
8235,2217,BrightnessOverride would fit the purpose except it requires IoT Embedded mode and therefore cannot use this API ,0
8236,2221, Clock app to control the brightness of display at night time,0
8237,2226,Apple announced support for Fragmented MP backed HLS Streams under HLS version url at WWDC ,0
8238,2227,We are looking to change the way our HLS streams are generated and Windows seems to be one of the few platforms that does not support playing these type of streams ,0
8239,2231,I have to make a stub of the class in the local project which causes duplicate of code ,0
8240,2232,I submitted this to the VS forum but they said to post the issue here ,0
8241,2234,if the DataTemplate x DataType models LocalStatus references POCO class that is in a seperate project the XAML will not compile ,0
8242,2239,We now have this option for ListView and GridView but not for the ComboBox control ,0
8243,2241,The StreamSocket class has no good way of polling the connection status without sending data your connection may have died minutes ago but you will not know until you try to send something which is not desirable ,0
8244,2242,Many of the old implementations in Net and even in VB socket control had this functionality and it was highly useful ,0
8245,2243,The proposal is to add something like Something happened update your UI or run your business logic,1
8246,2248,While downloading a file with BackgroundDownloader the progress updates every MB which is not really accurate ,0
8247,2249,I have noticed that pausing and resuming the download accelerates the update rate to about every ms ,0
8248,2251,This would allow us to easily use different ItemTemplates for each group in conjunction with GroupStyleSelector ,0
8249,2252,There are many cases where you have different kind of data and group them by data type ,0
8250,2254,imagine a image viewer where you have one group Folders and one group Images ,0
8251,2256,Or you display search results for various item types in one view ,0
8252,2257,It is possiblte to achieve this right now using the normal ItemTemplateSelector on ListView GridView ,0
8253,2258,But it causes a context switch from native net and back for each item which will slow down the control when showing a lot of items this is noticeable on slow devices or phones ,0
8254,2259,Plus as I read in the docs this can degrade virtualization performace as the control does not know upfront which items need which template ,0
8255,2261,Now the control does not need to call selector for every item speeding up the control ,0
8256,2271,' m writing this feedback in Desktop Bridge because I think this team is the innovative and will do a better job of communicating these problems to Windows Store team ,0
8257,2272,Desktop Bridge attracts me as a developer but Windows Store puts me off ,0
8258,2274,Currently the only way to find programs are if you type their names ,0
8259,2275,There are no keyword searches ,0
8260,2277,This has been like that for many years but no one has done anything about it ,0
8261,2278,If you wonder why developers are not jumping on to something as attractive as Desktop Bridge this is the reason ,0
8262,2281,There are many threads on Internet discussing this issue but Windows Store team does not seem to listen ,0
8263,2292,Otherwise the private store can only be used for in house apps or free apps ,0
8264,2293,A content control that enables the user to use inking to enter text in TextBoxes including RichEditBox ,0
8265,2295,Each JavaScript app that uses a Video element in the UI and calls the play function to stream the video preview from camera to the app page will Crash after recent Windows update ,0
8266,2300,This crash occurs in all JavaScript apps that use the MediaCapture API to display camera Video previews ,0
8267,2301,For this reason apps programmed in JavaScript that use Video or photo capturing are from now on non functional in Windows ,0
8268,2302,According to the documentation it is possible to x Bind events to a handler ,0
8269,2308,When working with parameters this works as long as the parameters have the default names ,0
8270,2309,So for the CalendarView SelectedDatesChanged event the following signature works ,0
8271,2314,This behavior is not found in public documentation ,0
8272,2327,But I could not find any option in my dev center account to support this functionality ,0
8273,2328,In emsad you can not read and write to the same texture and that is fine I can live with that ,0
8274,2329,However the API was designed that it will introduce severe overhead in the following scenario ,0
8275,2331,These objects are semi transparent alpha blending so I need to draw them sorted by distance to camera back to front and not by state changes ,0
8276,2332,Let us assume I have objects which are Soft Particles SP ,0
8277,2333,And objects that are triangle meshes TM ,0
8278,2334,Both SP and TM use alpha blending ,0
8279,2335,SP do not do depth writes but they do depth tests and depth reads in the shader ,0
8280,2337,TM do depth writes and depth tests but they do not do depth reads in the shader ,0
8281,2338,By depth writes I mean the D D DEPTH STENCIL DESC DepthWriteMask,0
8282,2339,So both SP and TM do legal operations they do not write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time ,0
8283,2340,However in the worst case when SP and TM are ordered in the following way ,0
8284,2342,I have to change the depth stencil view using OMSetRenderTargets for each draw call to set the same depth texture but with view that has D D DSV READ ONLY DEPTH enabled or disabled ,0
8285,2344,So in order to draw them all I have to do ,0
8286,2350,To my understanding OMSetRenderTargets is a slow operation but I need to call it times ,0
8287,2351,And the calls to OMSetRenderTargets are really useless because the same depth texture is used just with a different view and because both SP and TM do legal operations they do not write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time ,0
8288,2357, I do not need to create depth stencil views for each depth buffer one with D D DSV READ ONLY DEPTH enabled and one with disabled ,0
8289,2358, I do not need to call OMSetRenderTargets for each draw call where I want to change D D DSV READ ONLY DEPTH ,0
8290,2359,But I just stick to normal depth writes D D DEPTH STENCIL DESC DepthWriteMask,0
8291,2361,This artificial limitation is also the cause for bugs in WebGL in Chrome FireFox ,0
8292,2363,Once you start working on WebGL in MS Edge you will notice that you will encounter the same problem because in GLES WebGL it is legal to read from the depth texture while it is bound to the FBO and you will have to do checks for each draw call if depth stencil view needs to be changed to have D D DSV READ ONLY DEPTH or no ,0
8293,2368,Say I have objects to draw ,0
8294,2373,SP do not do depth writes but they do depth tests more,0

8296,2377,it is extremely annoying when I face service issues with devcenter with no knowledge if they are investigated or not ,0

8298,2379,With service issue I mean devcenter backend is down or does not work properly in some ways ,0

8304,2395,The main impediments when creating a Chat like control using a ListView is that we do not have a native way to handle incrementalLoading at the top of list ,0

8310,2409,Not sure why even having a web browser control if it is not going to have full browser features minus the tabs settings URL input box etc ,0
8311,2411,Since Edge does not support lockdown usage like IE did with Kiosk mode it makes it even more important to have this ,0
8312,2412,I add a CustomAudioEffect which is EQ I have also tried using official UWP sample is EchoEffect to MediaPlayer ,0
8313,2413,Although it seems CustomAudioEffect is running on Worker thread not UI thread it seems media playback would also be impact when UI loading a bit heavier ,0

8315,2417,Now that Xaml and DirectX support SVG images I would love to provide my splash screen image as an SVG file ,1

8317,2421, I would also be OK using a Xaml Path ,0
8318,2425,Apple has such a form and on the few occasions that I have needed to use it they have generally completed a review in a few hours ,0
8319,2426,This is useful for situations where a critical security flaw is identified or where a trade show or other immovable deadline requires an app get through the review process more quickly than usual ,0

8328,2442,The current support for Bluetooth LE in Win Creators Update does not allow publishing of an Eddystone beacon url because the api reserves the use of many data section types ,0

8330,2447,The closet option is to launch it FullScreen but that obscures the task bar ,0
8331,2448,Auto give little control over the first launch of the app ,0
8332,2449,This meant that I ended up using PreferredLaunchViewSize during first launch and then Auto on subsequent launches ,0
8333,2450,This is what I am currently using ApplicationViewWindowingMode Auto ApplicationViewWindowingMode PreferredLaunchViewSize ,0
8334,2461,This seems a bad way to manage window size ,0

8353,2517,When you use x Bind to bind a TextBox to a property of the SelectedItem of a ListView this problem exists ,0
8354,2519, you select a new item in the listView,0
8355,2521,Your changes from are lost because the selection in the ListView changes before the LostFocus event of the TextBox was raised ,0
8356,2522,That means the change was never written back to the original item ,0

8422,2661,I am looking to use ECDH key agreement in an universal windows app but I can not find a way to do so ,0
8423,2662,I have previously used the desktop NCryptCreatePersistedKey with NCRYPT ECDH P ALGORITHM followed by,0
8424,2664,I would have expected that this would be the way to start but there is no ECDH possible in url ,0
8425,2669, Note that this is not ECDSA the use of elliptic curve keys in a signature mode ,0
8426,2672,Which situation am I in ,0
8427,2673, I missed the documentation that explained how to do this ,0
8428,2674, Universal Windows Apps just can not do this and never will ,0
8429,2675, A later release will let me do this ,0
8430,2691,When adding or removing a lot of items we suspend the events and will raise a single event for all the items that were changed during the suspension period ,0
8431,2693,Before recent changes we were ab using the Reset event type to inform the UI components that the collection has changed ,0
8432,2694,In the current version we have optimized the collection so it knows exactly what has changed in the suspension state ,0
8433,2695,We will only invoke the correct Add Remove actions for all the items ,0
8434,2696,Unfortunately it looks like the UI components in this case a ListBox cannot deal with the Add and multiple items ,0
8435,2697,This does not work ,0
8436,2701,The event args implementation correctly contains all the added items and the right indexes all covered by unit tests ,0
8437,2714,For some notes on the investigation see url ,0
8438,2715,I think this is a bug in the way the UI components deal with the NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs instance ,0
8439,2716,If it is add the components do not loop all the,0
8440,2718,I do not see this limitation documentated anywhere but I might have missed it ,0
8441,2724,This makes the collection much faster to work with when making large changes ,0
8442,2728,In NET Native is still not mature and still has bugs ,0
8443,2730,Interestingly Apps wrapped with Desktop Bridge do not have to use NET Native ,0
8444,2734,I would like to create my own Windows Wheel implementation for an existing bluetooth device that sends events over the BLE GATT protocol not HID ,0
8445,2735,I know it is possible to use something like url but having to write c code for Bluetooth is holding me back ,0
8446,2736,I would much rather write some UWP like background application in C # that injects RadialController events ,0
8447,2737,When using a company Store account with associated developer accounts it is presently not possible for the developers to raise support issues for Store problems ,0
8448,2738,It requires the company account to be signed in to raise the case ,0
8449,2739,This is a real problem where we have multiple teams that are shipping apps and we need to share the ' master ' account name and password with lots of people thus removing any value of using AD federation ,0
8450,2741,WinAppDriver does not work with user annotation because AppiumFieldDecorator forces the GET context command which is not supported by WinAppDriver ,0
8451,2742,I understand WinAppDriver does not currently support WebView and therefore it does not support context switching so context command is not provided ,0
8452,2743,However the context switching is not required to support user annotated element ,0
8453,2745,Then Appium will happily use the native locator ,0
8454,2746,I can get the page source with current WinAppDriver and I see all the elements returned have the attributes for size width height or position x y but the values of those attribute are all zero ,0
8455,2747,I think this is the reason why Appium Inspector does not highlight the element position in the screenshot images when an element was selected in the App Source tree or clicking on the screenshot does not select the corresponding element in the App Source tree ,0
8456,2753,A Control for selecting an Emoji that works like the DatePicker control and a Flyout for selecting an Emoji that works like the DatePickerFlyout flyout ,0
8457,2757,Presently the only way to do this is through the print UI requires user interaction ,0
8458,2758,With SSDs and faster processors boot up is often times only a second sometimes less ,0
8459,2759,It has become difficult to both know what key you need to press and get the timing of the press correct to be able to access your BIOS ,0
8460,2761,i am using Windows and VS I have a Finguerprint sensor and Windows hello installed and working fine ,0
8461,2762,It detects finguers ,0
8462,2763,i am now developing a UWP app for multiuser registration using finguerprint ,0
8463,2764,For that propose i am using following part of code ,0
8464,2766,The problem I found is that it currently shows a UI dialog asking for current loged in user credentials confirmation ,0
8465,2767,It was suppose to show afther this the Windows Hello Settings page for finguerprint detection as is in the normal Windows Windows Hello Settings page ,0
8466,2768,Afther loged in user confirmation the dialog closes and no forther finguerprint detection is possible ,0
8467,2769,I dont know is this is a Security norm from Microsoft to not allow outside settings finguer detection ,0
8468,2772,and how develop more library for correctly use multiuser finguerprint registration and detection ,0
8469,2773,thank you Jose Lopes,0
8470,2784,Each number represents the shadow in each side ,0
8471,2788,In percent of cases I receive MeasureOverride exception or Error HRESULT E FAIL has been returned from a call to a COM component No matter what the problem is you will get that kind of useless information ,0
8472,2789,Which means that something went wrong ,0
8473,2790,No stacktrace and guess yourself is what WinRT development looks like ,0
8474,2793,I am using RichTextBox for editing the rtf text ,0
8475,2794,Initially if I have rtf text in first line and then after adding bullets to the same line the bullets does not appears in same color font and font family ,0
8476,2795,If the device is connected to a network speech recognition with local SRGS custom grammar it behaves exactly as if it did not have the local grammar and starts to communicate to the websockets platform bing com endpoint increasing by tens of times the waiting time for the result ,0
8477,2798,Even the official Microsoft UWP sample accuses the same problem ,0
8478,2801,For large teams just having one team member being able to do this is a bad design decision ,0
8479,2802,The API is fine but where I am running into trouble is that things like Flyouts and Dialogs intercept any and all access to the event ,0
8480,2803, Event registration order does not seem to make a difference ,0
8481,2804,This makes for problems with things like ,0
8482,2807, The SplitView captures the first BackRequested rather than the page navigation ,0
8483,2809,A Flyout with custom picker UI that uses BackRequested to navigate internally ,0
8484,2811,I am a developer trying to make a Discord app for Windows Phone Windows Tablet Xbox and HoloLens ,0
8485,2812,It is a significant limitation to not have an opus supported library and makes many features impossible ,0
8486,2814,I have tried to use the Microsoft ConnectedDevices Xamarin Droid with Xamarin Forms apps but it is difficult because the platform related methods such as oAuth are tied to the implementation of Android Activity ,0
8487,2816, a type of Horizontal one row ListView GridView ,0
8488,2818,Only Horizontal Scrolling available because it is one row only,0
8489,2822,When the user will press button for next items then items will scroll and next set of items will appear on the screen ,0
8490,2824,Example Best example is the youtube homepage has this control where suggested videos from different channels are shown in single row ,0
8491,2831,Scrolling Navigation Buttons on right side next button on left side of the control will be a previous button ,0
8492,2832,Next Previous Behaviour the available screen will show the max number of items in the row of the control according to size of the control and size of the items in it ,0
8493,2836,I have not found any possible way to do that so I assume it does not exist currently ,0
8494,2838,The SerialDevice implementation appears to be very unstable in general but doubly so when compiling as Native ,0
8495,2839,The following will reliably throw some flavor of interop exception ,0
8496,2840,This will reliably result in a BSOD if zero bytes are returned not clear why LoadAsync is not blocking either ,0
8497,2842,As of now it is only possible to set the CalenderIdentifier property to tell the control which calender to use ,0
8498,2843,It is not possible to set the Hijri adjustment for the month of Ramadan Shaban though which can vary per region user some users like to use the adjustment of a different country ,0
8499,2844,The Windows Calender app show cases this feature with their calender when you set the alternative calender to Hijri a new setting shows up which is Hijri adjustment and it works nice ,0
